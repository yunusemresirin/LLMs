    "text": "Controversial pastor picked for Mansfield patrol program. By Vickie Welborn vwelborn@gannett.com Gannett March 24, 2009 MANSFIELD -- Mansfield Mayor Curtis McCoy wants to start a pastor on patrol program for the Mansfield Police Department and he's selected as his first candidate a self-described minister with a controversial past that includes time spent on the other side of the jail bars and troubles with the court system. The Rev. Roy Jones' most recent job was a convenience store clerk for which he had to obtain an alcoholic beverage control card so that he could sell alcoholic beverages. \"This is something I'm trying to do to make a better relationship between the police and the citizens,\" McCoy said of Jones' appointment. Unlike a similar program run by the Shreveport Police Department where ministers volunteer their time to ride on patrol with officers, Mansfield's Pastor on Patrol won't depend upon volunteers - or at this point anyone beyond Jones. Jones will be paid $9 an hour and work 24 hours a week. Asked why he didn't use Shreveport's program as a model, McCoy answered, \"I don't know what Shreveport does nor do I care to know what Shreveport does on that line. I only know what Mansfield is doing. \"McCoy would not comment on Jones' checkered past or his ability to remain unbiased in situations involving the police and citizenry since he is on the city's payroll. \"Based on his relationship in the community as far as knowing people, every time I go to church, I see him in a pulpit - I'm serious. I'm talking the honest God truth. & If he's not pastoring, he's there as a guest. But he knows the people in the community, and I think over the years he has proven himself to be an asset. \"Part-time employees can work six months before being presented to the Board of Aldermen. That's why Jones' official appointment was news to two Mansfield aldermen. Mitch Lewis and G.B. \"Sonny\" Hall were unaware of Jones' addition to the payroll. Lewis admitted that he was questioned over the weekend about Jones being seen last week in a patrol car with a police officer. \"I talked to Roy today (at the council meeting),\" Lewis said Monday night. \"He said yes he was doing it, but he didn't go into it. He said he was pastor on patrol. He said he was trying to get involved with the youth on the weekend and stuff like, which I think is good, but & I don't know. I think (McCoy's) intentions were good to try to set up that type of program. \"Added Hall: \"Most true pastors volunteer their time to do that. \"Jones, who was unseated in October 2007 from his first term on the DeSoto Parish Police Jury, is a close friend of McCoy's. He's aided the mayor in his two election campaigns and frequently accompanies him to functions. Jones did not return a message left on his answering machine Monday. Jones grabbed his own headlines while on the parish governing body. He was consistently involved in employee issues and public criticism of the road department supervisor, including filing complaints with the state attorney general's office that were later deemed unfounded. The Mansfield resident got his own hand slapped in 2005 when the district attorney ordered him to reimburse the parish $175 for gravel he directed onto a private driveway. He has prior arrests for trespassing, issuing worthless checks, failure to appear in court for criminal neglect of family and for failing to report to court on issuing worthless check charges. While he spent time in the DeSoto Detention Center for his arrests, Jones has avoided jail sentences by paying off the insufficient funds and the late child support payments. McCoy said he would later evaluate the program and add a \"white minister, too, because we want everyone to have someone they can talk to.\" Jones is black.",

    "text": "Senate DFL proposes cuts, $2 billion tax hike. However, the DFL plan does not include $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money that lawmakers still do not know just how they can use. The Thursday announcement brought the first public acknowledgment that Democrats would increase taxes to help balance the budget. Senate Tax Chairman Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook, said a \"lion's share\" of the $2 billion in new revenue would come from higher taxes on the rich, apparently via the income tax. The plan calls for cutting every segment of state government, for a total of $2.4 billion. While the Democratic leaders say they would take roughly equal amounts of new taxes and program cuts to balance the budget, they have yet to figure out where to put about $2 billion in federal economic stimulus money. Given that, Senate Majority Leader Larry Pogemiller, DFL-Minneapolis, said education cuts may end up being moderated once details of how the state can spend the federal money are unraveled. The state's $33 billion two-year budget would be $6.4 billion short without cuts, new taxes and federal money. Pawlenty figures the federal money into his budget and calls the deficit $4.6 billion. He is to announce changes to his budget in the next week to 10 days, taking into account recent economic changes. Pawlenty's spokesman said it was good that DFL leaders \"are finally publicly admitting they'd like to wallop the families and small businesses of Minnesota with massive tax increases.\" Brian McClung added that the cuts did not look at funding priorities. \"An off-the-shelf computer program could do these kinds of across-the-board cuts,\" McClung said. \"We would expect more from DFL legislators.\" Tom Dooher, president of Education Minnesota, was not happy with the Senate announcement. \"The proposed cuts are not in the best interest of Minnesota\u00e2 s school children,\" Dooher said. \"If enacted, they would seriously harm the quality of education the state takes pride in providing its students.\" House leaders plan to announce their budget outline soon, too. House and Senate committees will work out details of their budgets, then establish conference committees to work out differences between the two budgets. Pawlenty often has said he will veto tax increases, and Pogemiller has said that he believes Pawlenty. A third of the budget balancing act Democrats propose relies on higher taxes. Bakk said he would not allow his committee to consider adding the sales tax to clothing or services. Other taxes may be considered, he said, although higher taxes on the rich are his primary goal. Bakk also said he would like to freeze the amount of money the state gives local governments at a time when most policymakers are calling for a cut in local government aid. Pawlenty would cut the aid, which has raised city leaders' ire. Local governments will be forced to enact moderate property tax increases to deal with the DFL budget, Bakk said, but less than under Pawlenty's proposal. Republican senators said they were not consulted about the proposal. They called tax increases job killers, supporting Pawlenty's proposed business tax cuts instead. Pogemiller said drastic measures such as the 7 percent cut are needed because of the current recession. Most of the cuts, he added, will be to programs most affecting the state's needy residents. He called the economy \"as bad, potentially, as the 1930s.\" The Minnesota House unanimously voted to support freedom of the press Thursday, after a week of controversy. House Minority Leader Marty Seifert, R-Marshall \u00e2 \u201c joined by House Majority Leader Tony Sertich, DFL-Chisholm \u00e2 \u201c brought a motion to the floor voicing that support because proposed House rules would have restricted media work on the House floor and in committees. The proposed rules emerged a week ago today, creating a stir among the Capitol press corps. Then, Monday night, a committee page demanded to see credentials from a photographer \u00e2 \u201c two hours after a House leadership spokesman assured the media that no credentials would be needed to cover committee meetings. Seifert said recent events had \"a chilling effect\" on the press. \"I am very concerned about what has taken place recently.\" Sertich said the proposed rules will not be implemented. He said there has been confusion as the rules were being discussed and no changes should have been made by House staff members. Rep. Torrey Westrom, R-Elbow Lake, said the talk of stricter press rules is a sign of bigger problems with DFL leaders. \"I know the press isn't really happy with some of the moves going on around here,\" Westrom said. \"I'm glad they are speaking up.\" Numerous House members have told reporters that they also were not happy with the proposals.",

    "text": "Local volunteers join flood fighting effort in Fargo. Tastefully Simple and The Alexandria Blizzard coordinated an effort to bus 300 volunteers from the Alexandria area to the affected area Tuesday. As the National Weather Service stuck to its prediction that the Red River will crest at 39 to 41 feet in Fargo-Moorhead on Friday, the mounting stress of a potential record flood began to take its toll. \u00e2 Fear is setting in,\u00e2 said Salvation Army Captain Adam Moore. \u00e2 We\u00e2 re seeing that on the streets. \u00e2 As of 8:15 p.m. Monday, the Red River level in Fargo was 27.58 feet. Weather service officials warned that a storm system moving into the Red River Valley from Nebraska overnight could drop up to an inch of rain over a widespread area before the rain turns to snow Wednesday. Despite sporadic showers Monday, Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker said the city \u00e2 had a good day. \u00e2 Fargo tried to speed up the dike-building process by deploying a portable wall system that\u00e2 s used to protect soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan from bullets and grenades. Sharon Mueller watched from near her home just off 40th Avenue South as a payloader filled a wall of the Hesco containers with sand. Under the road, large ice chunks floated down the swollen Drain 27. Mueller, a retired bartender, said she couldn\u00e2 t believe how fast the rising water was running. She said that despite her husband\u00e2 s complacency, she was worried about flooding. \u00e2 Can you imagine what Noah must have felt like? \u00e2 she said. Sandbagging hit high gear in the metro, as high schools let out students and colleges canceled classes to aid the effort. North Dakota Governor John Hoeven said students would be forgiven for missed school days. About 30 Concordia College students stacked sandbags around Barb Groth\u00e2 s house in Oakport Township north of Moorhead, where several hundred volunteers pitched in. Groth, whose home flooded in 1997 when the Red River crested at 39.57 feet, said she didn\u00e2 t think a repeat was possible. \u00e2 I never thought it could happen again. We\u00e2 re nervous,\u00e2 she said. Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty stopped in Oakport and Moorhead, urging state residents to join the flood fight. About 230 Minnesota National Guard troops were helping with flood efforts, and he said he expects that number will eventually reach about 400. Hoeven said the state\u00e2 s National Guard committed 500 soldiers to the water war, with more available. Fargo raised its goal for daily sandbag output to 300,000 to try to fill 2 million bags by Thursday. \u00e2 If those neighborhoods hold, we are safe as a city,\u00e2 said Fargo City Commissioner Tim Mahoney. \u00e2 If we\u00e2 re unable to do that, we\u00e2 re going to have a problem. \u00e2 The city was prepared for a Red River crest of 38 feet. Now, city officials want to get the dikes up to 42 feet, Mahoney said. At 41 feet \u00e2 we lose a lot of houses,\u00e2 he said. \u00e2 If we\u00e2 re going to get this thing done, it\u00e2 s going to have to be done in the next 24 to 48 hours in a massive way. \u00e2 The Fargodome, where volunteers waited for bus rides to Sandbag Central, the city\u00e2 s utilities building, became its own sandbag-filling station with hundreds of shovel-wielding volunteers scooping sand dumped on the parking lot. Sandbaggers kept spirits up despite the gloomy weather and flood outlook. Fargo plans to give residents routes out of town Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, said Pat Zavoral, Fargo city administrator. \u00e2 There are some locations in south Fargo where if the water does break away from these [dikes], they won\u00e2 t be able to use Interstate-29,\u00e2 he said. Fargo Police Chief Keith Ternes urged residents to go to the city\u00e2 s Web site and register for the Code Red alert system so they can be reached in an emergency. Residents with land lines are already registered in the system. Sandbagging efforts continued overnight. City officials hope they get 300 people an hour to help fill sandbags at the city\u00e2 s utility operation center at 2301 8th Ave. N. and 1,000 people an hour at the Fargodome. Hoeven asked for a presidential emergency declaration based on preparation efforts because of the costs. He said he thinks the state might get it today.",

Complete Count Committees are appointed by the mayor or other elected official and include leaders from the business, education, faith, media, non-profit, ethnic and other communities. These volunteer committees work together on community events such as festivals, parades, meetings and other activities to keep Minnesota first in the nation in responding to the census. The 2010 census is critical for Minnesota, which is at risk of losing one of its eight seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, according to census officials. Census information is also the foundation of equal representation in the state Legislature and determines the allocation of more than $300 billion in federal funding for everything from education to transportation. The business community also uses census information for planning, marketing, labor force projections and more. Additionally, the census will employ an estimated 8,000 Minnesotans throughout the process.",

He noted this is a seasonal issue that happens almost every year. In addition, water has caused a portion of County Road 56 to wash out. This road is located west of County Road 15, southwest of Brandon. Lastly, a culvert on County Road 96 is washed out, closing a portion of the road, which is located northeast of Kensington by Freeborn Lake. \u00e2 Right now, these are the only three [county] roads that are closed,\u00e2 said Robley. He asked that motorists use caution when driving around the county and if there is water flowing over the road, motorists should not drive on it. If there is standing water, he said proceed with caution. With Tuesday\u00e2 s storm dumping even more snow on the area, Robley said public works will keep a close eye on area roads, but he said that depending on the conditions, he wasn\u00e2 t too concerned. Another road in pretty bad shape \u00e2 \u201c probably the worst shape of any in the county, said Robley \u00e2 \u201c is County Road 42. The road is scheduled for a major overhaul this spring, so for right now, the county is patching as needed to keep it together. \u00e2 We are doing what we can to keep it safe,\u00e2 said Robley. He noted the utility work for the project should start in April and the actual roadwork should begin shortly after that. He also mentioned there are plenty of other roads around the county with potholes or other problems that the public works department is working on, which he said is a normal occurrence this time of year. Robley added the roads may seem to be in worse shape this year because of the colder than normal temperatures. He reiterated that the amount of snow doesn\u00e2 t make as big of an impact as the cold temperatures. A wet fall helped drive the frost deeper, which wreaks havoc on roads. The county didn\u00e2 t use anymore salt or sand than it usually does, added Robley. Throughout the spring and summer months, the public works department will continue its maintenance of area roads \u00e2 \u201c repairing, patching and crack sealing, as needed.",

    "text": "Grand Jury Indicts Man In December Slaying. When Alexandria police found the body of Juantissa Hill, 24, inside her Van Dorn Street apartment early last December, she had not shown up for work in two days. Her family, friends and coworkers waited for her missing Nissan Altima to turn up, hoping that it would lead police to the person who raped and killed the young Navy petty officer who worked at the Pentagon. Hill\u2019s car was eventually found without a suspect inside, giving investigators only leads. On Monday, about three months later, an Alexandria grand jury indicted 31-year-old Rodney Eric Smith on charges of first-degree murder, forcible sodomy, robbery and grand larceny. As with the majority of rape and assault cases, Smith and Hill knew each other, according to Deputy Chief Blaine Corle, commander of police investigations. \u201cThis was not a stranger case,\u201d Corle said. \u201cWe do know that they had some prior contact. We don\u2019t have any reason to think that this was a case in which there was any danger to the public of a random assault.\u201d Smith was arrested and convicted of \u201ca relatively minor charge\u201d in another state, according to Alexandria Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Randy Sengel, who will head Smith\u2019s prosecution. Sengel would not identify the jurisdiction but said Smith was sentenced there and is currently incarcerated while awaiting a transfer to Virginia, where he will stand trial. Smith is also wanted in a third state for failure to appear in court in relation to other charges but will likely be sent to Virginia next under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers. \u201cThere is also another jurisdiction that has a warrant for him but we\u2019ve been in touch with them and we\u2019re going to try to coordinate [his transfer to Virginia],\u201d Sengel said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that our case is by far the most serious of the cases and they won\u2019t have any problem with us going ahead [with a trial].\u201d Alexandria detectives worked with Naval Criminal Investigative Services in searching for Hill\u2019s rapist and killer, utilizing military resources to investigate Hill\u2019s background \u2014 her characteristics and associations \u2014 in hopes it would lead them to a suspect. \u201cAny time you work a homicide investigation, getting to know a lot about your victim is often equal to where the case leads you,\u201d Corle said. \u201cAnd NCIS was very cooperative in helping us find out about Ms. Hill and \u2026 her background \u2014 who she associated with and things like that. All the things you just have to start digging from scratch on.\u201d The leads police obtained in the case originated in Alexandria and the surrounding area, according to Corle. Police also received help from the public but \u201cthis just happens to be one of the cases where \u2026 the lion\u2019s share of the success came from the work of the detectives in Alexandria,\u201d Corle said. Police did not say exactly how they connected Smith with the homicide but Alexandria Police Spokeswoman Ashley Hildebrandt said the nature of his arrest and conviction in another state was \u201cunrelated\u201d to the type of crime inflicted on Hill. Sengel would not comment on whether it was related to sexual assault. Sengel estimated that Smith\u2019s transfer to Virginia would take 60 to 90 days citing the suspect\u2019s recent sentencing in the other jurisdiction and the copious amounts of paperwork necessary for an interstate transfer. Once here, he would go directly to trial in Alexandria\u2019s Circuit Court, but given the circumstances and nature of the case, Sengel estimated that it could be a minimum of 90 days after he is transferred until Smith stands trial.",

    "text": "School Board Hopefuls Square Off. It only took about five minutes before the persistent achievement gap in the Alexandria City Public Schools came to the forefront and the city\u2019s school board election season began in earnest. The achievement gap \u2014 the gulf in graduation rates between white students and minority students in Alexandria, which the current ACPS board and senior staff has addressed several times over the last few months \u2014 was the central theme of the questions addressed during the Tenants and Workers United\u2019s public forum Wednesday night at Cora Kelly Elementary School. The five District A school board candidates (Helen Morris, Mimi Carter, Bill Campbell, and incumbents Scott Newsham and Sheryl Gorsuch) answered each question in turn, some open-ended and others requiring a not-so-simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d While some of the candidates shared similarities in their approaches to cutting the achievement gap, each had their own take-home message. \u201cThe biggest way to make a dent [in the achievement gap] is on improving the engagement of everyone involved, especially families,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThe way to improve the engagement of families is through improving our communications \u2026 We need to go out and meet families and parents where they are.\u201d Campbell went on to stress the importance of cultural competency and having the community firmly believe all students can achieve. Morris stressed the importance of coordinating the relationships inside and outside of school and that the school system needs to be willing to meet the community part of the way. \u201cEducation needs to be a partnership between parents, teachers and the children themselves, and if there is, and there\u2019s a good roadmap, then our children will succeed,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIt involves rigorous academics, community involvement in education and it involves character education.\u201d Carter keyed in on accountability within ACPS and the need for a solid foundation from which to go about improving achievement among minorities and English language learners. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a system set up for our teachers to engage with our parents, the best communication system in the world will not work,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWe really need to figure out how to set up these very basic things like translation services, bilingual staffing in the schools, start there and then set up a more systemized approach to engage parents.\u201d Newsham, an incumbent, reiterated what he would continue to do as a school board representative, setting policy and obtaining the necessary resources for students to be successful, something that starts with the pending strategic plan and continues with high expectations in a rigorous curriculum. \u201cI think the best way to close the achievement gap is to implement the strategic plan that the board has spent the last six to nine months developing,\u201d Newsham said. \u201cWithin the school system over the last three years we have come to realize that there is an achievement gap, that it is a serious situation and that we have the means to address it.\u201d As the other incumbent in District A, Gorsuch said that the board needs \u201cto really analyze the data\u201d on the achievement gap, discuss the issue, and look at the issue as early as preschool. \u201cI think that the achievement gap happens before our students even hit school,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cPreschool is going to be an important part of our future discussions in the school system. \u201cThe predictor is there, we know that kids who don\u2019t pass the third grade [Standards of Learning] test are generally the ones who don\u2019t have preschool and that predicts a high probability of dropping out later.\u201d TWU organized the forum as a venue for community members to get to know who the candidates are and come away with a better understanding of their thoughts on issues that most closely affect the black and Latino community in Alexandria. The Special Education Advisory Committee is holding the next scheduled public forum \u2014 for all candidates \u2014 on March 31 at Minnie Howard, with the time yet to be determined. On April 20, the Upper King Street Neighborhood Association is co-hosting a forum for District A candidates with the Inner City Civic Association and the Old Town Civic Association at the Durant Center (7:30 p.m.) The Departmental Progressive Club has organized its public forum for April 29 (7 p.m.). The Alexandria PTA Council will host three forums, one for each district: the District A forum is planned for April 22 at Mt. Vernon, District B on April 20 at Minnie Howard and District C on April 27 at Samuel Tucker. All of these forums are slated to begin at 7 p.m.",

    "text": "'Free' Money Headed to Alexandria. It\u2019s not as simple a concept as the traditional Santa Claus delivering presents to a struggling family at Christmas, but the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, better known as the federal stimulus package, has City Hall creating a wish list for the money\u2019s allocation. And the complexity of the funding has the city checking that list over and over and over again. The proposed list, comprised of needs from city departments, once consisted of hundreds of projects worth over $600 million on which the city hoped to capitalize. Officials did not expect to receive that vast amount of funding, but dubbed it part of their vetting process to allocate the money. Since President Barack Obama signed the Act, that list has been narrowed down to about 25 to 30 projects, according to Mayor Bill Euille. But receiving stimulus money and implementing it in the city\u2019s best interest seems to be consumed by the dense bureaucracy of federal lawmaking and the fluid nature of the stimulus package itself. Some money will also go through the state to be allocated by Governor Tim Kaine. \u201cEverything is changing on the dime, hour by hour, day by day,\u201d Euille said, a day after spending four hours on the Hill with other mayors and Congressional delegations. Officials would not prioritize the various projects they hope to achieve, but have set up an intergovernmental system to monitor the myriad stipulations and rules crowding around the free money. Essentially, it is a task force that will make sure projects fundable by the Act won\u2019t fall through the cracks while making sure projects that qualify meet the necessary criteria. The City Council will have ultimate say, according to a memo that places the body at the top of the chain, and although the city has its own priorities, they do not always parallel the funding available from the stimulus package. The city will have to prioritize according to other factors as well, like speed. \u201cExpediency will be important, and those projects that are \u2018shovel ready\u2019 will be more likely to receive federal funding,\u201d stated City Manager Jim Hartmann in a memo to the mayor and City Council that reflected a briefing from Congressman Jim Moran (D \u2013 8). \u201cCertainly we have some potential to do things that were not otherwise on the priority list but are important long-range projects,\u201d City Manager Jim Hartmann said. \u201cMuch of the energy efficiency items \u2014they have a long term payback for the city. So frankly we welcome those things.\u201d The most recent published wish list (which consists of much more than 30 projects), contains everything from restructuring the city marina to repaving Interstate 395 to helping victims of the recession. Among 12 other committees in the workflow, the implementation committee has the job of obtaining the actual grant funding for such projects as well as clearing any hurdles to obtaining funding. \u201cThe implementation committee is going to look for, primarily, barriers to implementation,\u201d Hartmann said. \u201cIf we have a priority project [we will] move it as fast as we can while being mindful of the rules and regulations that we have in the city.\u201d Money from the stimulus package was not accounted for in the city\u2019s current proposed budget, so some of the money could supplant or offset budget gaps, even if the city cannot use them as part of the budget, perhaps having to utilize itemized grants based on the stimulus plan\u2019s stipulations. \u201cThe devil\u2019s going to be in the details,\u201d Hartmann said. \u201cWhether certain stimulus spending might be seen as supplanting the budget depends on if it\u2019s allowed or not. If there are things in the budget where we could use stimulus funds instead of using city funds that could be used for other critical areas, certainly those will be considered. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to calculate what that net benefit may be. I think there will be a smaller portion of offsetting things within the budget, but it will be able to help us accomplish other goals that maybe were not funded in this budget.\u201d Citing the fluid nature of the process and the numerous departments in line and in need for funding, officials would not prioritize one project over another. But Hartmann gave the \u201cclassic\u201d example of Polk School Gymnasium, a \u201cshovel ready\u201d project that has already been designed and is awaiting funding to be realized. Still, it is not yet certain if the project has a money pot available. \u201cI don\u2019t have the authority to say this project is going to go ahead of that project,\u201d Euille said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a total collaboration because we have every department and agency involved.\u201d There is no distinct timeline on when final decisions will occur; it will take more time for the bill\u2019s contents to take a tangible shape and the city will be doing more evaluations and setting priorities \u201cI think the next two months are going to be very instrumental on what we\u2019re going to be doing,\u201d Hartmann said.",

    "text": "New School to Open in Old Town . This fall, the classical education is coming back to Alexandria, but almost half a year and several large hurdles remain before the school can officially open its doors. The move to establish the Washington Latin School, led by T.R. Ahlstrom and Headmaster Tom Soule, is gearing up for the start to its academic calendar on September 8 at a location yet to be determined in Old Town. The school hopes to attract students with a rigorous, classics-based curriculum and a significantly reduced tuition, due to the current economy. Students enrolling for the school\u2019s first year will pay an annual tuition of $14,000, plus other fees, during the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 school years, roughly $10,000 less than the original sticker price. Once the school\u2019s financial base is strong enough, Ahlstrom and Soule plan to admit students on a partial- or full-scholarship basis \u2014 the founders are aware that the $24,000 average price tag is not possible for everyone \u2014 making it financially viable for students from lower-income backgrounds to attend. \u201cMy take on this, and T.R. and I have talked about this before, is \u2018classics for everyone,\u2019\u201d Soule said. \u201cFar too often that kind of education isn\u2019t available to people of all socio-economic backgrounds.\u201d Ahlstrom said that the results found at the Washington Latin Public Charter School in Washington, D.C., one of two public Latin schools that he has helped found in the last seven years \u2014 Bronx Latin in New York City is the other \u2014 prove that people of all economic backgrounds can thrive in the demanding, classical setting. Currently, there are three locations in Old Town being looked at as the school\u2019s initial home, Soule and Ahlstrom said. The educational philosophy at the Washington Latin School in Alexandria is somewhat similar to Ahlstrom\u2019s previous two endeavors, but is setting out as an independent, privately funded school rather than one receiving public funds. \u201cThis is my third school in the last seven years,\u201d Ahlstrom said. \u201cThe other projects were very successful, and we believe this one will be more successful because we\u2019ve chosen not to do it as a public school, but as an independent, co-educational classical school. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a basher of public schools, I\u2019m a product of them. The fact of the matter is that there is one kind of school in this country for prosperous people and another kind of education for everyone else.\u201d Both Ahlstrom and Soule worked at the Washington Latin School Charter School before leaving in late 2007 to start the independent school venture. Soule said that by then, they \u201chad reached a ceiling\u201d with what they were able to do educationally at the charter school and wanted to move on to a new situation that would allow for more independence. According to Soule and Charter School Board meeting minutes, the D.C. Charter School Board disagreed with Ahlstrom\u2019s proposal to move the school from Northwest D.C. to Penn Quarter and ultimately nixed the idea. The charter school\u2019s current headmaster, Martha Cutts, came on after Ahlstrom and Soule left, but said that in the time since the school has continued to flourish, swelling to 341 students this year from 179 only two years before. In 2008, the school opened a second campus in D.C. for its eighth and ninth graders, and applications for the upcoming school year are up 74 percent, Cutts said. While it appears the charter school is established and growing, the Washington Latin School in Alexandria has its own set of hurdles to clear. Getting students and their families to move away from their current schools could be considered one of the project\u2019s biggest obstacles, but Ahlstrom and Soule are confident that the niche they\u2019re trying to fill with the Washington Latin School is one that will not struggle to attract students. \u201cThere\u2019s no problem getting kids and families to commit,\u201d Ahlstrom said. \u201cEvery school we\u2019ve ever done, there\u2019s a long line at the door. There will be here, too. The real challenge is funding without getting public money.\u201d Donna Molinari of Alexandria Country Day School said that the Latin School is starting in much the same way that ACDS did in the 1980s, and that based on the differences in curriculum the new school probably would not affect its enrollment too much. \u201cI think they have their reputation behind them to help propel them forward, and it\u2019s a curriculum that\u2019s been around for a while, and that will help them,\u201d Molinari said. \u201cOf course, the hurdles are those that all new schools face, and are affected even more so in a tough economic climate.\u201d During a March 17 public meeting at Charles Beatley Library, Ahlstrom dove into some of the financing they\u2019re looking for with the new school. Aside from tuition for the students enrolling in the first year \u2014 fifth grade, sixth grade and seventh grade only \u2014 the school is looking for 10 \u201cfounding families,\u201d each of whom would pay $100,000 in the first year, covering the child\u2019s tuition through graduation. In addition, the school is looking for 12 individuals or corporations to contribute $200,000 each over the next five years in order to solidify the school\u2019s financial base. \u201cIs it hard work? Yes. Is it more difficult because of this economy? Of course,\u201d Ahlstrom said. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked the question, \u2018How can we turn this negative economy in a positive thing?\u2019 And I think we\u2019ve done that.\u201d The plan is to add a new higher and lower grade each year, but for the first year the school is hoping to draw about 50 students, enough for a single cohort of fifth, sixth and seventh grade students. Alexandria City Public Schools, experiencing its own enrollment increase, are not expecting the new school to affect what they do to any great extent, but are eager to see what comes about, Director of Communications Amy Carlini said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how it works out,\u201d Carlini said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting to see what happens.\u201d",

    "text": "Standing by Sudan. As unfavorable ideas go, this one is a corker, as far as Egypt is concerned. The choices that confront Sudan preoccupy Egypt. One danger, for both Egypt and Sudan, lies in failing to think clearly about short term and long term. In the short term, peace in Darfur is a priority for both Egypt and Sudan. In the long term, Sudan's territorial integrity and national sovereignty are at stake. \"Egypt seeks peace and we don't have a hidden agenda,\" President Hosni Mubarak declared. Egypt proposed a United Nations conference to discuss the ICC indictment of Bashir, even though the Sudanese government declined Cairo's bid on the pretext that it might lead to the internationalisation of the issue. Southern Sudan is rich in economic resources, which attracts Western and Asian, especially Chinese, interests out to make a quick kill. With this in mind, Egypt understands the gravity of the threat that faces Sudan. Peacekeepers have a deplorable record in Sub-Saharan Africa. Their failure to protect civilians from ill-disciplined government troops and pro-government militias is proverbial. In Sudan the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) has so far kept a relatively low profile. Some 1,500 Egyptian troops are currently stationed in Darfur, even though certain Darfur armed opposition groups objected to the Egyptian participation in UNAMID, most notably the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan Liberation Army. Egypt was one of the first countries to send its UNAMID contingency to Darfur. In the turbulent aftermath of the ICC indictment of Sudanese President Al-Bashir the future of the hitherto buoyant Sudanese economy may be in jeopardy. \"This is the last thing Egypt wants. Egypt would like to see a prosperous, politically stable and peaceful Sudan,\" El-Feki explained. \"Egypt is poised for participating positively in Sudan's economic uplift.\" \"As far as Egypt is concerned, the indictment of President Al-Bashir by the ICC would have a detrimental impact on the Sudanese economy. That is neither in the interest of Sudan nor Egypt,\" El-Feki added. The cost to Sudan of withholding aid might be high at a time of global penny- pinching. But the consequences of inaction will be far higher. It is against this backdrop that Egypt is prepared to help Sudan in any fashion the Sudanese people require. Sudan is bracing itself for a big bang and a perfect storm. The country stands at the crossroads. This is a testing time for the current and future administrations of Sudan, and Egyptian officials are acutely conscious of the Sudanese conundrum and are at pains to explain that they would back whatever decisions the Sudanese people adopt. If push comes to shove, managing a potentially tricky Sudanese transition will not be easy. Moreover, it would be a protracted affair and may prove awkward for both Egypt and Sudan. For all these reasons, Egypt assumes its responsibilities to drive forward this necessary new Sudan. Tacit agreement to do nothing would be dangerous for both neighbours. There are other reasons for caution. The need for dialogue between all the rival Sudanese factions is pivotal. \"It is for this reason that Egypt attempts to maintain close contacts with all the various political groups, both government and opposition,\" El-Feki stressed. \"At the same time we should work on initiatives to drive forward a more productive, more democratic Sudan,\" he concluded. Egypt may not have much leverage over Sudan, but a rift in bilateral relations between Egypt and its neighbour to its immediate south will be detrimental to both countries. The balkanisation of Sudan will come at a time when Egypt can least afford it. \"But this is a question for the Sudanese people to determine.\" \"We are only concerned about Sudan's interests and the welfare of its people,\" Mubarak stated categorically. He dispatched Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul- Gheit and General Intelligence Chief Omar Suleiman to the Sudanese capital Khartoum to discuss the latest crisis concerning the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for President Omar Al-Bashir. Egyptian officials concur that the primary purpose of Egypt's solidarity with Sudan is to advance the interests of the \"two fraternal neighbouring states,\" as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the People's Assembly Mustafa El-Feki told . \"Sudan constitutes the strategic depth of Egypt and is key to its water security and potentially for its food security too. Sudan's agricultural potential is tremendous and yet untapped. Egypt is prepared to step up its agricultural investment in Sudan. And, we are prepared to work with representatives of all the various Sudanese groups and regions. If the southern Sudanese people decide to secede, we are ready to accept and respect their choice. If they decide to stay within a federal Sudan, we will back them. Among numerous joint ventures, we have established a branch of the University of Alexandria in the southern Sudanese capital of Darfur.\"",

    "text": "Godless in Godapitiya. One prediction about Sri Lankan political developments in 2009 that can be made with absolute confidence is that wanton terrorist acts of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE) will not diminish. This is partly because the have-nots and in particular disgruntled elements of the ethnic Tamil minority have many grievances. Talk about incorporating the Tamil community more in the decision-making process of the island- nation nonetheless continue and the former deputy leader of the LTTE Vinyagamoorthi Muralitharan has been appointed non- cabinet minister for natural integration and reconciliation. Many Tamil separatists have come round to accept that unless they start at least to talk about their own eventual disarmament and incorporation into the Sri Lankan political establishment, they will find it extremely hard to get many of the ethnic Sinhalese majority on their side. However, many Sri Lanka analysts believe that peace is just a pipe dream. If the Tamil moderates show no sign of living up to this side of the bargain, the Sinhalese majority's resentment will multiply and will become less and less willing to agree to further power-sharing schemes. There was a time when many influential Tamils had opted for independence. Centuries of progroms and panics taught Tamils that the Sinhalese leaders always have a better hand than their own Tamil leaders. But here is a paradox. There are important segments of the Tamil community with a vested interest in preserving the unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. However wonderful in theory it is to remove the Tamil Tigers' threat once and for all, incidents such as the unfortunate terrorist attack on Tuesday denote the notion of relegating the LTTE to the sidelines like so much pie in the sky. The hard-headed practitioners of realpolitik like Sri Lanka's former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga will not for the moment be joining the fray. Oddly enough what will drive the incessant talk about elevating the status of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka are the hardliners of the ruling party. Nobody in the Sri Lankan political establishment is certain that the LTTE will honour a later promise to disarm. Divisions in the ruling United People's Congress of Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse do not inhibit the government's resolve to end the LTTE uprising. The Sri Lankan civil war, which erupted in 1972 when LTTE took up arms against the government, has so far claimed the lives of some 70,000 people. When historians look back on his presidency, they may well judge him most on whether he managed to quell the Tamil uprising. According to the pro-LTTE Tamilnet website, 75 civilians were killed last week as a result of Sri Lankan government army shelling of LTTE-administered areas of the island. It is estimated that around 200,000 civilians were trapped in the war zone in the northern parts of the country. The Sri Lankan government accuses the LTTE of using the civilian Tamil population as human shields, but by all accounts, the LTTE appears to be losing the battles on the ground and resorting in desperation instead to its timeworn tradition of terrorism. Tamil separatists can be said to have invented suicide bombing and hold the record, a most sorry one. The participation of senior government officials in a Muslim festival was a show of sectarian solidarity, which renders the attack all the more poignant. The suicide bombing occurred in the town of Akuressa, in Matara district some 160km south of the Sri Lankan capital Colombo. The Sri Lankan government is now taking stock and looking at how these figures are adding up. Hopes are high that things will get better. The Sinhalese political establishment will have to re-sell what contemporary Sri Lanka stands for. They will be tested by the Tamils' terrorist acts. Ambassador Ansar explained that the bombing was supposed to cause maximum damage and loss of life. Sri Lanka has a Muslim population of more than two million, geographically concentrated in the eastern part of the country. They have generally been neutral in the war between Tamils and Sinhalese, refusing to take sides. The leader of the Tamil separatists Veluppillai Prabhakaran is still at large and sporadic armed conflict in the north of the island is expected to continue unabated even though the observers anticipate an escalation of terrorist attacks throughout the island nation and perhaps even against Sri Lankan interests overseas. Ambassador Ansar, a Sri Lankan Muslim himself, noted that peace will inevitably be a long, drawn out process. \"We will need all the support we can muster from our allies overseas. The international community must extend its cooperation in face of terrorism and we must fight together.\" Yes, it has been a traumatic week for Sri Lanka. Some 14 people were killed and scores were injured, including Sri Lanka's Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Mahinda Wijesekara, as they joined thousands of pilgrims to the holy shrine at the historic mosque at Godapitiya. No less than six ministers took part in the celebratory procession marking \"This is a barbaric attack on innocent civilians. The LTTE had suffered a series of military setbacks in the past year and has been cornered in the northeastern part of the island.",

    "text": "Slight sigh of relief. Ahli can sleep a bit more comfortably after Petrojet beat Ismaili on Monday 1-0. The win stymied Ismaili's attempt to catch Ahli, the defending champions, who remain atop the leader board with 42 points after 21 games. Enppi and Petrojet are tied with 39 points and 22 games played. Ismaili drop to fourth on 38 points after 21 games. Observers say Ahli are lucky to still be in the lead after collecting just three points from their last four matches. Ismaili, who seeks to win their first league title since 2002, had blown the title race wide open with a 1-0 victory over a depleted Ahli side at Cairo Stadium. That was followed by a 0-0 draw in which 10-man Ahli failed to find their way through Police Union's tight defence. They also could not avenge their 1-0 defeat to Talaat Youssef's side in the first half of the season. Ahli's mercurial midfielder Mohamed Barakat was sent off in the second half for picking up two yellow cards, one for simulation in the penalty area and another for a clumsy tackle on a Police defender. Palestinian keeper Ramzi Saleh made his third successive start, replacing the error-prone Amir Abdul-Hamid and did admirably in keeping his net clean. Ahli coach Manuel Jose made two substitutions during the second half in a bid to improve his side's attack. Strikers Hani El-Egeizi and Ahmed Belal were introduced to play alongside Flavio but the pair, who do not play regularly, were obviously not fit. Jose's plans suffered another blow after Barakat received his marching orders six minutes past the hour mark for lunging at an opponent. The Portuguese tactician was forced to substitute Angolan hitman Flavio with right-back Ahmed Sedik. Ahli kept pushing forward despite their numerical disadvantage but failed to carve out any clear-cut chances. Police held firm to secure a share of the spoils with the defending champions. Police Union moved to ninth place on 27 points, seven clear of the relegation zone. Ahli assistant coach Hossam El-Badri refused to blame referee Gehad Greisha for his side's goalless draw. \"I can't say that the referee cost us a win. He did not make any profound mistakes,\" El-Badri stated. \"Our players played well but were unlucky in the first half and matters went from bad to worse when Barakat was sent off. \"The competition will be fierce in the upcoming games, but I don't want Ahli supporters to be worried because we are determined to keep our title.\" Indeed, Ismaili's loss to Petrojet did go quite a ways to Ahli capturing their fifth straight league crown. Police assistant coach Mohamed Ibrahim lauded his team's defence that put Ahli strikers at bay throughout the match. \"We were aware that Ahli will keep pushing forward during the whole game,\" Ibrahim said. \"Credit our defenders for successfully marking Ahli. We succeeded in achieving our target of avoiding a defeat.\" Elsewhere, no sooner had Zamalek ended a six-game run without a win by beating Enppi 1-0 than they failed to build on their win by losing 2-1 to Haras Al-Hedoud and equal their worst record of nine Egyptian Premier League defeats in one season. Egyptian Cup winners Haras Al-Hedoud, who will play in next season's CAF Confederation Cup, moved into fourth place on 36 points as they continued their impressive form under manager Tarek El-Ashri. Al-Hedoud managed to break the deadlock after just five minutes. Ahmed Abdel-Ghani curled a superb free- kick over the wall and into the corner of the net past the hapless Abdel-Wahed Al-Sayed. Zamalek defender Amr El-Safti thought he had equalised shortly afterwards after Al-Hedoud keeper Mathurin Kameni spilled a tame cross into his path, but his goal was ruled offside. Zamalek still had better possession but rarely threatened Kameni as the efficient Al-Hedoud doubled their advantage on 27 minutes. Talented midfielder Abdel-Salam Nagah whipped in a pinpoint cross from the right and Abdel-Hamid Bassiouni rose above the static Amr Adel to head home. Sherif Ashraf, who came on as a second-half substitute, pulled one back with 13 minutes remaining but the hosts held onto their lead to claim all three points. Despite their defeat, Zamalek assistant coach Sami El-Sheshini was pleased with his side's performance. \"We are gradually improving. We played a very good game tonight, especially in the second half,\" El-Sheshini told reporters after the match. \"I just want Zamalek fans to be patient. The players produced promising displays and I'm sure the results will be better in the upcoming matches,\" El-Sheshini added. After the loss to Al-Hedoud, Zamalek lie ninth in the league table on 27 points, seven above the relegation zone. In other matches, Enppi remained in the title race with a 1-0 victory over Egypt Telecom, failing to end a 12-match winless streak in manager Hossam Hassan's debut. Al-Gaish produced an impressive display to beat Ittihad 4-1 on Saturday. The big win lifts Al-Gaish to eighth in the table with 29 points. Ittihad remain sixth, one point ahead of Farouk Gaafar's men. Ernest Papa Arku broke the deadlock for Gaish on 33 minutes, before a brace from Salah Amin (63, 81) and a 90th minute strike by Yassine Abdul-Aal sealed the win. Mohamed Ragab scored Ittihad's consolation in the 83rd minute. In Port Said, Tersana showed determination to remain in the first division by beating Misri 2-0. Ismaili were handed a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Esperance in the Arab Champions League (ACL) quarter-final first leg played in Tunisia last week. Mickael Eneramo broke the deadlock on 27 minutes before Oussama Darragi doubled Esperance's lead in the second half while Mohab Said scored a vital away goal for Ismaili 12 minutes from time. The home side opened the scoreline when Abdel-Hamid Sami brought down Michael Eneramo in the box. The Nigerian successfully sent Mohamed Sobhi the wrong way. As the Egyptian club tried to push for an equaliser, they were exposed at the back and Esperance looked closer to adding a second. Early in the second half, Eneramo was once again allowed to go one on one with Sobhi but the 28-year-old net minder did well to keep the shot out. In the 73rd minute, Darragi added his team's second by capitalising on some poor defending from Ismaili to slot home past the helpless Sobhi. Ismaili were brought back to life when Abdullah Saied's cross found Said unguarded on the far post, the midfielder easily heading past Kasraoui. The two teams will clash again in the tie's second leg in a week's time in Ismailia.",

    "text": "Rethinking Egypt-US relations. Since Obama took office, hopes for better times spread over the Middle East. Egypt, which often had trouble communicating with the administration of George Bush Jr, is now hoping for improved bilateral ties. At least since the 1970s, three main themes dominated Egyptian-US relations: the peace process, the situation in the Gulf, and financial assistance. These themes may offer us some guidance as to how the future will look. Egyptian-US partnership regarding the peace process started in earnest with Jimmy Carter, who sponsored the Camp David Accords and the subsequent Egyptian- Israeli Peace Treaty. The sense of mutual commitment to peace survived throughout the administration of George Bush Sr and his secretary of state James Baker, culminating in the Madrid Conference for peace in the Middle East in 1991, the international gathering that endorsed the \"land-for-peace\" formula. The second theme of cooperation was Gulf security. During Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Egypt was instrumental in forming the international coalition to roll back the invasion. The third theme was US assistance to Egypt which, despite what its detractors may say, has helped rebuild Egypt's infrastructure for the past few decades. During the 1990s, economic assistance began to be phased out. And certain efforts were made through the Mubarak-Gore partnership to create a free trade zone as an option to help the Egyptian economy. But the Clinton and Bush Jr administrations didn't pursue that option in earnest. Cooperation on all three of these issues diminished during the presidency of George Bush Jr. The Palestinian problem, in particular, suffered as a result. The Bush administration started out by blaming the Clinton administration for involving the US too greatly in the Arab-Israeli conflict. US indifference concerning the Palestinian problem continued until the Bush administration finally admitted that something needed to be done. Subsequently, the administration said that it favoured a two-state solution. US rhetoric, however, was not matched by action. On the contrary, the Bush Jr administration undermined the concept of a geographically-connected Palestinian state when, during a visit by Israel's prime minister to the US in July 2004, it said that Israel may hold on to major settlements in the West Bank and Jerusalem. And for all the visits by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to the region, the Bush administration failed to come up with cohesive policy on the Palestinian issue and largely ignored the question of settlements. It was only recently, and timidly, that Rice admitted during her last visit to the region that the building of settlements was not helping the cause of peace. As for cooperation over Gulf security, this cooperation receded when the Bush administration ignored the warnings and advice of Egypt and invaded Iraq. The invasion, as we know now, sowed only turmoil in the region. It damaged the US's image, increased terror, and turned Iran into a key regional power. Another thing that marred Egyptian relations with the previous US administration was the latter's misguided ideas on democratisation. American arguments were often viewed in Egypt, even by civil society organisations, as interference in Egyptian internal affairs. This brief survey of Egyptian-US relations shows that Egypt cooperated closely with Washington at times when US policies were positive, as in the times of Carter and George Bush Sr. But tensions were unavoidable during the time of Bush Jr. Much now hinges on the US taking a fresh view of the Arab- Israeli conflict, one that casts away the conventional bias towards Israel that has so far undermined the quest for an acceptable solution. Much depends also on what the Obama administration does about extracting itself from the Iraq morass, restoring peace and stability there and the Gulf, and handling the Iranian nuclear issue. This analysis may seem to suggest that responsibility for moving forward on Egyptian-US relations rests solely with the US. Of course, this cannot be true. Egypt, for its part, needs to build its credibility in the region. If anything, this would persuade the Americans that Egypt is a country one should listen to, even when one doesn't totally agree with what it says. Egypt needs also to embrace democracy, revitalise its economy, stamp out corruption, and pursue an enlightened cultural course. Former US ambassador to Egypt Dan Kurtzer recommended in a recent paper that Washington and Cairo should realise the importance of their bilateral relations and listen carefully to what each other has to say. I cannot agree more.",

    "text": "What policy? . Apart from Shimon Peres giving Hillary Clinton a kiss on the cheek, nothing much emerged from the first visit to the Middle East of the new US secretary of state. We have no indication of where the policies of the Obama administration are heading. Actually, it seems so far that there is no tangible change from the policies of the former administration. During her visit to Israel, Clinton spoke in favour of the two-state solution but said she has no intention of talking to Hamas. Clinton had nothing to say about the need for Israel to stop building settlements all over Palestinian land. Nor did she have anything to say about the Gaza tragedy. She didn't mention the need to open the crossings and follow up on the efforts Egypt is making to bring about a calming down period. And yet Clinton made a point of empathising with Israel with regards to Palestinian rockets. And she fully understood Israel's concern over the prospects of Iran developing nuclear weapons. Clinton kept her options open concerning future talks with Syria and Iran. Washington seems prepared to engage the Syrians in dialogue if this helps Damascus distance itself from Tehran. And the Syrians seem willing to go to any lengths to stay on Washington's good side. It seems that the US wants to see moderate Arabs and Palestinians negotiating with Israel, although actually the Palestinians have been doing just that for quite some time now to no avail. Israel expressed strong reservations about any negotiations with Tehran, and obtained a promise that Washington wouldn't formulate its policy regarding the Iranian nuclear question without consulting with Israeli officials first. And it seems that Clinton bought Livni's claim that moderate Arab countries are more concerned about Iran than Israel. Some Arab countries were ecstatic that Clinton's first visit to the region started in Sharm El-Sheikh, where she attended a conference for the reconstruction of Gaza. I don't know how relevant this is to anything. What I know is that Arab countries have failed to ask for anything specific. They have failed to come up with a cohesive view and to relay it to the Americans. At present, the Arabs have no policy for dealing with an Israeli right-wing government led by Netanyahu. The designated prime minister has never showed any interest in peace, aside from what he sees as \"economic peace\"; namely, any arrangement that allows Israel to exploit the resources of the region at will. It may be too early to speculate on the future of the region as Washington sees it. But by the look of things it seems that Washington is hoping that the region will turn against Tehran and all radical groups affiliated with it. But what's in it for us? Hostility to Iran can only benefit Israel and divide the Arab world. It would be a continuation of the same circumstances that led to the tragedy in Gaza. Clinton came to the region with Iran on her mind. The main issue -- namely, the Arab-Israeli conflict -- is not being addressed for now. And it is unlikely to be broached before a new Israeli government is formed. I know some people are hoping to see Clinton give her backing to Egyptian efforts for a calming-down period in Palestine and for inter-Palestinian reconciliation. But I find it worrisome that we still have no idea how the Obama administration might react to someone like Lieberman becoming Israel's next foreign minister. The man is a racist who insulted the Egyptian president, threatened to bomb the High Dam, and described the Palestinians as insects. How will Washington deal with such a man? More importantly, how will Cairo deal with such a man?",

Twin sisters Lindsay and Charlotte Graham, students at St. John's Lutheran School in Lombard, won first- and second-place awards respectively in the annual Sheldon Peck letter-writing contest. Each year Lombard fifth-graders pretend to be Sheldon Peck, an early Lombard settler and portrait artist, writing to Abraham Lincoln in 1848. This year more than 40 handwritten letters were judged on historical accuracy, letter-writing skills and student research on pioneer life in Babcock Grove (now Lombard). The awards were given Sunday at Sheldon Peck Homestead in Lombard. Lindsay received $40 with her first-place certificate and Charlotte received $25. The third-place certificate and $10 was given to Amanda Chlebek, a fifth-grader at Pleasant Lane School. The winning letters will be featured in a Lombard Historical Society newsletter and Lombard's TV Cable 6. Roselle police ticketed hundreds of motorists last month as part of a traffic crackdown partially funded with state grant money. Police said they issued 584 citations for speeding in February. They also made 13 DUI arrests and wrote 63 tickets for failure to wear a seat belt. Another 115 citations were issued for other violations. The grant money Roselle police received from Illinois Department of Transportation covered the cost of overtime for speed enforcement. Roselle officers this month are continuing the speed enforcement efforts. DuPage Sheriff John Zaruba is warning residents about two recent scams that his deputies are investigating. In one case, a resident who lives near Bensenville lost an undisclosed amount of money when they followed a caller's instructions to wire money to Canada for a family member's bond. The resident assumed the caller was truthful since the family member was named but, later, the resident learned that relative had never been arrested and was not even in Canada. In the second scam, a resident who lives near Glen Ellyn reported a telephone scam in which a caller requested the victim send money to cover processing fees for his Canadian Lottery winnings. The victim became suspicious and, instead of sending the money, alerted authorities.",

    "text": "Stores a sign of better times in Schaumburg? . Could new Whole Foods and Crate & Barrel stores in Schaumburg be the first green shoots to spring up from the economy's winter-frozen soil? Schaumburg trustees Tuesday approved a site plan for a 34,000-square-foot Crate & Barrel store at the intersection of Woodfield and Martingale roads. It joins an already approved 65,000-square-foot Whole Foods on the former site of the John M. Smyth Homemakers building razed last summer. Community Development Director Christopher Huff said the Whole Foods is expected to begin above-ground construction this spring, with the Crate & Barrel next door to begin shortly after. Both are expected to open in the late spring or early summer of 2010. Though both projects have been in the pipeline for a few years, their going forward at this point is seen as a very significant step. \"To me, it's the first sign of a recovery of some sort, because they didn't pull the plug on them,\" Huff said. The twin projects' importance is not lost on the village department whose task it is to track economic growth - or its relative absence recently. \"It's a pretty big deal because we're down about two-thirds from what we were at a year and a few months ago,\" Huff said. \"We're happy to see any new development,\" Senior Planner Tom Farace agreed. As actions speak louder than words, the two companies are demonstrating a belief in the bright future of their location just south of Woodfield Shopping Center and west of the Streets of Woodfield, Huff said. Elected officials also saw a ray of sunshine in the projects. \"I think they see the same light at the end of the tunnel that I do,\" Mayor Al Larson said of the renewed show of confidence from these two businesses. Corporate officials for Northbrook-based Crate & Barrel couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday. But last summer they said they've had a policy of moving their houseware stores from malls to larger, separate lots in order to sell furniture as well. The company has had a store at Woodfield since 1979.",

    "text": "Grand jury indicts pair in Des Plaines nun scam. A federal grand jury in Milwaukee has returned a three-count indictment against a Chicago couple accused of posing as destitute Kenyan refugees and scamming Carmelite nuns in Pewaukee out of more than $800,000. Acting U.S. Attorney Michelle Jacobs announced the indictment Tuesday charging 35-year-old Angela Martin-Mulu and 39-year-old Edward Bosire with mail fraud. The two Kenyan citizens arrived in the U.S. in 1999 and received political asylum in 2007. The indictment said the two targeted religious orders by claiming they suffered from illnesses and needed money for medical bills or education, at the same time maintaining apartments in Chicago and Bolingbrook, Ill., and spending much of the money at casinos or on things unrelated to medical or educational expenses. An FBI affidavit has said the married couple first visited the Pewaukee monastery in December 2004 and told the nuns they were brother and sister, homeless and would be killed if they were deported to Kenya. Prosecutors said the nuns gave them cash and checks over a three-year period, totaling about $815,000 before the scheme was discovered. Sister Mary Agnes has said the money came from the nuns' health fund, and she declined to say how much of the fund had been depleted. She said the nuns don't have health insurance because it's too expensive.",

    "text": "Pool operators look to prevent another crypto outbreak. Last summer, a crypto outbreak scared plenty of people away from public pools and water parks across North Texas. \"No system will completely take crypto out of a pool,\" said Chris Swartz, NRH{-2}O manager. \"But this is state-of-the-art in recreational water management.\" The ultraviolet disinfection system is among the approaches cities and private water park operators are taking to address what has become a serious problem. Last year, 476 cases of crypto were reported throughout Tarrant County. In July, crypto was discovered in the water of Burger\u2019s Lake in west Fort Worth; a swimmer was identified as the source of the infection. Throughout the summer, cases of crypto were reported and linked to various public pools. Crypto cases are on the rise in Texas and nationwide and health officials aren\u2019t sure why. Last year in Texas there were 1,981 confirmed cases, up from 233 in 2007, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The increase might be due to heightened awareness of the parasite and increased reporting, said Michele Hlavsa, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Instead of thinking 'Where did I eat?\u2019 people are thinking 'Where did I swim?\u2019 \" she said. What makes crypto so difficult to deal with is its resistance to normal levels of chlorine and ability to survive more than 10 days in water. Many area cities plan to hyperchlorinate, or shock, pool water using high amounts of chorine. While that is an effective way to treat crypto, it cannot prevent an outbreak. The best thing people can do is avoid swimming if they have been sick, said David Jefferson, environmental health manager for Tarrant County Public Health. \"What people have to remember is when you are in a swimming pool, you are in other people\u2019s bodily fluids,\" he said. Even an ultraviolet system has limitations. The devices work by interfering with the DNA of a parasite, making it unable to reproduce. But the parasite must pass through the ultraviolet system, which can take six hours, before it comes back into the pool clean. \"Before all the water gets treated, crypto is still sitting in the water,\" Hlavsa said. Hyperchlorination does a great job of lowering the amount of crypto in a pool, but it doesn\u2019t have a lasting effect, Hlavsa said. Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, which had no crypto cases last year, is among several facilities planning to hyperchlorinate its pools. \"It\u2019s the easiest and most effective thing to do,\" park spokeswoman Sharon Parker said. Keller has considered a UV system but for now will focus on educating the public about healthy swimming habits and following the public health department\u2019s recommendations, said Dona Roth Kinney, director of parks and recreation. The bottom line is that it\u2019s up to people to prevent an outbreak by avoiding public pools for 10 days if they have had gastrointestinal symptoms, Jefferson said. \"Swimmers are bringing it into the pools, and they\u2019re the ones who can keep it out,\" he said. Wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers. Change diapers in a bathroom or diaper-changing area and not at poolside. Wash children thoroughly with soap and water before they go swimming.",

Baptize me!\" Church leaders didn\u2019t believe in baptizing a child so young, but she was adamant, so they relented, relatives said last week. She was the one to encourage the family to have a weekend barbecue, to get her parents to take a trip to Cancun, to find the best deals on a cute handbag. \"She was kind of like the one who kept things moving,\" said her mother, Mamie Underwood. Ms. Underwood, 34, of Arlington, died Tuesday of an unknown cause. The Tarrant County medical examiner\u2019s office is investigating the cause of death. Ms. Underwood was an answer to her parents\u2019 prayers for a child, her mother said. She was the second of three. \"She was a prayer warrior,\" her mother said. \"She was a fervent believer in God and his power and in praying and the power of prayer. She believed when there was a problem to pray.\" Ms. Underwood, born Dec. 20, 1974, spent the first 10 years of her life in Wintersville, Ohio, before the family moved to Arlington. Her father is an engineer, and her mother is an employee of the federal General Services Administration. Ms. Underwood was an honor student and graduated from O.D. Wyatt High School in Fort Worth in 1993. She attended law school at Texas Southern University in Houston. Her younger sister, Kalena Horhn of Grand Prairie, said she remembers riding on a Big Wheel with her big sister in front. \"She was full of wisdom, of hopes and of dreams,\" she said. Ms. Underwood\u2019s mother said she often went out of her way to help others. When a friend lost her job, Ms. Underwood invited her to stay with her, rent free. \"Her heart was not as big as Texas,\" her mother said. \"It was bigger than Texas.\" Other survivors include a 15-month old son, Kingston James, and her father, Gary Underwood.

MANSFIELD \u2014 The Law Enforcement Center will get some parking relief and other improvements and repairs if the City Council approves a $765,000 financing package today. About $85,000 has already been used for emergency repairs to mechanical and electrical systems. Among the remaining projects is expanding parking at the center to keep up with the growing number of staff members. \"We\u2019ve been out of parking for years,\" Patrol Commander Kyle Lanier said. The council meeting is at 7 p.m. at City Hall, 1200 E. Broad St. Lanier said the renovations, which could begin by mid-April, would also include electrical work, fencing, gates, painting and landscaping. None of the scheduled improvements are for the patrol division, where officers are finishing their own volunteer remodeling effort. They have replaced drywall, repainted, installed cabinets and overhauled bathrooms, saving $50,000 to $100,000, they say. In other action, the council will consider authorizing staff to take advantage of lower interest rates and refinance about $10.3 million of city debt. Officials estimate savings of $450,000 over the life of the bonds. Last week, after recent action by the council, late Public Safety Director Steve Noonkester\u2019s name was placed on the side of the Mansfield Public Safety and Municipal Court Building.

Three Eastland County residents were charged with arson after fires burned more than 260 acres and five structures in Eastland and Callahan counties, according to the Texas Fire Service. Brian Freeman, 23, Christina Utley, 20, and Michael Thomas, 24, each face five charges of arson and one charge of organized criminal activity, the service said in a statement. \u2014 Alex Branch \u2014 Negative comments on MySpace apparently caused an argument Monday that ended with one 14-year-old girl stabbing another girl in the chest with a pair of scissors at Handley Middle School, police said. The victim, also 14, suffered \"two small, shallow puncture wounds\" that were not life-threatening, said Lt. Paul Henderson, a police spokesman. She was taken to Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center. The argument between the girls escalated at the school, police said. One girl grabbed a pair of scissors and stabbed the other girl repeatedly in the chest. The suspect was taken to a juvenile detention facility. \u2014 Alex Branch",

In her 20s, she married Noorallah Moayyad, a man of the Baha\u2019i faith, which advocates the unity of world religious and teaches that leaders such as Jesus, Muhammad and Buddha were all divine prophets. After growing up Jewish, \" she had to embrace Christianity and then embrace Islam, and she understood that religions come in succession and improve,\" said Ms. Moayyad\u2019s daughter-in-law Nadia Moayyad of Southlake. Ms. Moayyad died Saturday of complications from a stroke. She was 85. After 30 years of raising a family and practicing Baha\u2019i in Iran, Ms. Moayyad and her husband moved to North Texas in 1973, Nadia Moayyad said, in part to be near their five children, who were all living in the United States. None has been able to return since the Islamic Republic under Ayatollah Khomeini supplanted the Shah of Iran. \"All of the Baha\u2019is had to leave Iran during the revolution because of the religious persecution,\" Nadia Moayyad said. \"We don\u2019t know when we will ever go back until there is religious freedom and then respect for all faiths.\" Ms. Moayyad spoke only French and Farsi when she moved to Arlington, Nadia Moayyad said. She soon learned English so she could get her driver\u2019s license. The Moayyads started a business, U Frame It, in Arlington. After her husband died in 1992, she allowed two grandchildren to take over the store, although she still worked there for several years. \"She was a very kind and loving lady,\" Nadia Moayyad said. \"I think her presence there was always felt with the customers.\" Ms. Moayyad\u2019s funeral will be observed by a family saddened by the loss but bolstered by the Baha\u2019i belief that death is a new beginning. \"It\u2019s not a sad occasion,\" Nadia Moayyad said. \"It\u2019s really a birth to a world where our soul is going to live eternally.\" Other survivors include sons Parviz Moayyad of Houston, Edward Moayyad of Southlake and Hamid Moayyad of Colleyville; daughters Parvin Davari and Nasrin Sadeghan, both of California; 13 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.",

    "text": "Arlington council OKs drilling near residential area. ARLINGTON \u2014 The City Council voted 8-1 Tuesday to approve a gas-drilling site on a picturesque horse farm in north Arlington. Titan Operating was granted a specific-use permit to drill on 3.5 acres of Martha Rose May Martin\u2019s 40-acre horse farm at North Cooper Street and Green Oaks Boulevard. Titan, which has not drilled in Arlington before, plans to drill 20 wells on Martin\u2019s farm over five years. The company spent more than $23 million acquiring mineral rights from 2,200 property owners surrounding the site. On Tuesday night, more than 200 residents packed City Hall to weigh in on the proposal, most to voice support. Among those in favor of the site was former Mayor Elzie Odom, who was one of 2,200 property owners in the North Arlington Neighbors association who signed a lease with Titan last year. Martin told the council that the decision to allow drilling on her property, which features open pastures, rolling hills and grazing horses, was not taken lightly. \"I have a profound love and connection with my property, which has been owned by my family for six generations,\" she said. \"This property is a little bit of heaven for my family and neighbors.\" Councilman Robert Rivera, who represents southeast Arlington, voted against the permit, saying he shared concerns about safety and property values with residents near the site. Three months ago, the city\u2019s Planning and Zoning Commission unanimously rejected Titan\u2019s request. Commissioners did not publicly comment on why they denied the permit, but city staff and council members have expressed concerns about the gas wells\u2019 impact on the land\u2019s future development, the visibility of the wells from busy Cooper Street, and the effects of an industrial operation on property values and quality of life. Cliff Mycoskie, who presented Titan\u2019s permit request to council, said the gas company has agreed to implement several measures that will reduce the operation\u2019s impact. Among them, he said: Titan will use urban drilling rigs, which require less energy to run and can be assembled more quickly, put up sound buffers, limit truck traffic during peak hours and install a masonry fence and landscaping along Cooper Street before drilling begins, which could be as soon as next year. Mycoskie pointed out that farther north, Huffines Communities wants to build a master planned community on undeveloped land across from the city landfill that already has numerous natural gas drilling sites. The community, called Viridian, will feature a town center and homes ranging from $300,000 to more than $1 million. \"If it worked at Viridian, it can work at this site, too,\" Cliff said. Those who spoke in opposition, many of whom live within 600 feet of the site, said they were concerned about the safety of living so close to an industrial site and the negative effects on property values. They also said they were disappointed to lose the peace and great view they have from living so close to the farm. Melinda Vanderberg, who lives on Bucknell Drive, urged the council to consider alternate sites away from the neighborhood. \"This site is literally in my back yard. There are many families and they live dangerously close to this industrial drill site that is going to go on for seven years,\" she said. Resident Landry Burdine said nearby drilling sites on Washington Drive and at Rolling Hills Country Club could extract the gas. \"This is not a necessary drill site. There are ample drills sites to serve this area,\" said Burdine, a developer who put together the deal to acquire and demolish the dilapidated Madison Creek and Hampton Hills apartment complexes on Washington Drive to make way for a natural gas drilling site. Supporters of the permit said they believe Titan will keep its promises to minimize the effects of the drilling and preserve the horse farm\u2019s character. Charles Parker said that residents have the right to access their minerals and that royalties would benefit people affected by the recession or are living on a fixed income. \"These rights are all inheritable. Whatever is pumping out of that ground when I\u2019m dead and done is going to go to my children,\" Parker said. Ellen Boyer, North Arlington Neighbors organizer, said she supports natural gas drilling as a way for the country to move away from dependence on foreign energy. \"We have a responsibility to develop the natural gas resources with which we have been blessed,\" Boyer said. \"I know our development in north Arlington is only a baby step, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\"",

Ellis said the driver told police that while she'd seen the elderly woman walking in the neighborhood before, she didn't see her when she started backing out of the driveway today.

Grand Prairie police are investigating the death of a 16-year-old who was killed and another who was injured early Sunday after an altercation at an Arlington party. The Tarrant County Medical Examiner identified the Arlington teen as Mitchell Taleferio, but police said Taleferio was the teen\u2019s first name. According to police, Taleferio was at a party with friends and may have gotten into an altercation with another group of teens. After he left the party with his friends, their red 1991 Honda broke down and they stopped at an Exxon gas station on Mayfield Road and State Highway 360 to fix it. A red Dodge Durango with a group of teens who may have been at the party also drove to the gas station and started fighting with Taleferio and his friends. Taleferio and his friends left the gas station and stopped about a half-mile away at a light at Forum Drive and Mayfield Road in Grand Prairie when the Durango pulled up next to them. Shots fired from the Durango struck Taleferio in the back of the head, police said. The Honda's driver, another 16-year-old, also was struck and suffered non-life threatening injuries. The injured teen drove to USMD Medical Center in Arlington, and Taleferio was later airlifted to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth where he was pronounced dead, authorities said.",

    "text": "School layoff policies rethought . School districts aren't yet laying off teachers, but most in Northeast Georgia either are reviewing or changing policies that will allow them to fire veteran teachers if they need to. The policies make seniority less of a priority when deciding which teachers to keep and which ones to let go - part of a trend that started more than 10 years ago to allow school districts to keep newer teachers with promise even if they had to cut positions. Last week, the Clarke County Board of Education began to take public comment on a new policy that would replace a 25-year-old rule that made seniority the only factor when administrators eliminate jobs. And in January, the Oconee County school board made similar changes to its policy, deciding to use a ranking system for seniority as a secondary measure to evaluate the value of an employee. Most Northeast Georgia school systems haven't had to consider layoff policies - dubbed \"reduction-in-force plans\" - for two decades because enrollment growth forced schools to hire more and more. But enrollment has slowed in places like Jackson and Barrow counties - which were among the fastest-growing counties in the state a few years ago - and since state funding is tied to enrollment, that means less state funding. Plus, the state reduced funding for public schools across the board by 2 percent this year, while next year's plans call for an additional 3 percent reduction - worth about $7.3 million for a school system like Barrow County. To make up for funding cuts, schools have implemented a hiring freeze and are not replacing many teachers who retire or move away. At the same time, property values and sales tax revenues are stagnant, meaning there is likely to be less local money for schools. As administrators consider cutting staff, some systems are revisiting their policies to make sure they can keep teachers with stellar records and teachers who can coach or have an in-demand specialty like special education, even if they have fewer years on the job. While Clarke and Oconee update their layoff policies, school boards in Barrow, Jackson and Madison counties tweaked their own only a few years ago. Under the newer policies, even tenured teachers who work in a district for more than four years aren't guaranteed they'll keep their jobs, said Phil Hartley, an attorney for the Georgia School Boards Association. \"It's becoming harder and harder to justify 'How do we get rid of the five-year teacher whose test scores are superior to the 20-year veteran teacher's?\" Hartley said. \"The school district has to have a way of making a decision based on criteria that it feels it can fairly apply for a reduction in force.\" School administrators still will consider a teacher's seniority, but only after looking at job evaluations, classroom observations and test scores. Seniority-based layoff policies still are the standard for most large school districts. Today, all but five of the nation's 25 largest school districts use seniority as a basis for cutting staff, according to the National Council on Teacher Quality, a Washington-based organization that encourages stronger state teacher-quality policies. Still, basing layoff decisions on more subjective standards may have flaws, too, said Tim Callahan, a spokesman for the Professional Association of Georgia Educators. \"If performance would be the sole criteria for a reduction-in-force, I think there would be a great amount of subjectivity and unfairness because of the system that we have,\" Callahan said. \"I think if the reduction-in-force plan considers several matters including performance, there might be more of a chance for fairness, but frankly, what we're hearing out there is mass reductions at the cheapest possible rate with not a whole lot of care and thought into a reduction-in-force policy.\"",

    "text": "New call for help in lynch case . MONROE - Federal and state law enforcement officials are nearly certain there are people living who can help them solve the 1946 Moore's Ford lynching. Top brass from the federal Department of Justice and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation made a plea Saturday in Monroe - just a few miles from the site of the country's last mass-lynching - for the public's help with one of their coldest cases. \"With a pretty good degree of certainty, almost 100 percent, there are individuals here in Walton County who can help us solve this and provide details that would fill in the blank,\" said Gregory Jones, special agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta office. Jones, GBI Director Vernon Keenan and Cynthia Deitle, the FBI's civil rights unit chief, were among the panelists at a Saturday discussion and film screening on the murders in the Walton County seat. Law enforcement officials sought to show they are serious about prosecuting the murders, in which an angry white mob shot to death two black sharecroppers and their wives July 25, 1946, at the Moore's Ford bridge between Walton and Oconee counties. They also wanted to continue publicizing the case and call for anyone with information to come forward and help with the investigation. \"If we could solve the case through sheer resources, that would be done, but that is not what occurs,\" Keenan said. \"We've got to have cooperation from people who have direct knowledge or evidence about what happened. They have got to work with law enforcement for us to be able to prevail and solve this case.\" At the same time, the panelists admitted the difficulties inherent in investigating a nearly 63-year-old case and tried to tamp down expectations. \"We still have some things to do, but I certainly don't want to raise expectations,\" Jones said. However, he said, \"We're not finished, and there are a number of things that we continue to pick up on.\" No matter how gruesome the crime, the rules of evidence still apply, Keenan said. The horrific nature of the lynching of Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, and the national attention it received in the summer of 1946, caused federal officials to put an \"unprecedented amount of pressure\" on FBI agents to solve the case back then, Jones said. Two dozen federal agents swarmed the area, interviewing people and identifying 160 persons of interest. But they ran into a wall of silence from the local community and couldn't put together a case to arrest anyone. Today, the case still is a priority for the FBI and GBI, the panelists said, but they still face a problem with cooperation from people who may know something. \"It's not just a standard cold case homicide,\" said Deitle, whose office is in charge of investigating a number old civil rights era crimes. \"It's also a case where some victims' relatives, witnesses and even some perpetrators are still paralyzed by a climate of fear.\" Of the 107 cold cases the FBI currently is reviewing, the Moore's Ford lynching is the oldest and involves the most victims and alleged perpetrators, Deitle said. There have been a few breaks in the case in recent years, though none appear to have gone anywhere. Last year, FBI and GBI agents executed a search warrant at a house in Walton County's rural Gratis community. After digging in the backyard of the home, agents seized some items and sent them to the GBI's crime lab. Keenan declined to discuss the items seized or any other evidence in the case Saturday because it could inhibit the ongoing investigation. Several years ago, Keenan thought about releasing to the public the GBI's investigative file on Moore's Ford, he said following Saturday's event. He discussed it with the state attorney general, but they decided against it because there still is a chance of prosecution, he said. \"I have seen many cases that we considered to be stagnant that ... there was no activity on and then with a phone call we suddenly piece together a case and go forward with an arrest and prosecution,\" he said. \"That has happened many times in my career so I never believe that a case is hopeless. And I don't believe this one is.\" Saturday's event, sponsored by the Moore's Ford Memorial Committee, also featured a screening of filmmaker Keith Beauchamp's documentary on the killings for the TV One network.",

    "text": "Attorney insists client not competent for trial . The attorney for a mentally ill man accused of stabbing an Athens-Clarke police officer nearly to death wants another jury to consider whether the defendant is competent to stand trial. Assistant public defender Benjamin Pearlman is arguing that, after a one-day civil trial last fall, a jury contradicted a state psychologist's finding that Steven Anthony Eberhart is incompetent. And, he said, mental health professionals still believe Eberhart isn't sane enough to understand what he did or help in his defense. Pearlman keeps in contact with the staff at East Central Regional Hospital, and every specialist involved in treating Eberhart \"continues to have the opinion that he is still not competent to stand trial,\" Pearlman argued in documents filed last month in Clarke County Superior Court. Pearlman can't defend Eberhart effectively, because his client can't hold a rational conversation about his case, he said. \"It's basically unconstitutional to put a person like that on trial, and it's my responsibility to say that Steven's not in the state of mind to stand trial,\" Pearlman said. \"Even if a jury found he might have been competent before, when someone has mental health issues, their status can change month to month, day to day,\" he said. Authorities say Eberhart, 45, attacked Sgt. Courtney Gale with a kitchen knife on Dec. 11, 2007, repeatedly stabbing the uniformed officer as she worked an off-duty security guard job in the Kroger store on Alps Road. Gale spent two weeks in a coma, had several surgeries to save one of her legs and went through extensive physical and cognitive rehabilitation. A grand jury indicted Eberhart on a criminal attempt to commit murder charge and 10 other felonies, and in September, a civil panel in Clarke County Superior Court determined that Eberhart, though he has a history of schizophrenia, is competent to stand trial. Jurors heard a state Department of Human Resources psychologist testify that Eberhart continued to \"experience psychotic delusions, consistent with his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia,\" according to court documents. Eberhart has been held at the Augusta psychiatric hospital since soon after his arrest in December 2007. He couldn't attend his own arraignment hearing Feb. 4, so the court entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Pearlman filed the request for a second competency trial immediately after the jury finding. Prosecutors are not required to respond, and Superior Court Chief Judge Lawton Stephens has yet to rule on the request. Pearlman already asked the state Court of Appeals to overturn the competency decision, but the court dismissed the appeal in December, stating it lacked jurisdiction. District Attorney Ken Mauldin declined to comment on the request for another competency hearing, other than to say, \"Of course, (Eberhart's) already been found competent by a jury, and they are raising that issue again, saying he's not competent at this time.\"",

    "text": "Madison will dump assessors . DANIELSVILLE - Madison County commissioners voted Monday to wipe clean the county Board of Tax Assessors by dismissing all four members. The county attorney will draft a letter of dismissal for the assessors laying out the reasons they're being dismissed and letting them know when they can appear before commissioners to tell their side of the story. Monday's vote, which was unanimous, comes after commissioners voted to take away the assessors' power over personnel and after Commission Chairman Anthony Dove requested that all the assessors resign. The tax assessors office and its governing board have been in turmoil for years and failed to finish the county's tax digest on time for nearly a decade. The chronically late digests - compilations of the value of all taxable county property - have caused confusion for taxpayers, who may have to pay two years' worth of taxes in 2009, Dove said at Monday's meeting. \"When you're hired to do a job, if you do not do your job in a week, you're let go - certainly, if you do not do that job in years,\" he said. Dove said he was forced to take action after the assessors recommended only one candidate in four months to fill the long-open job of chief appraiser and after the interim chief offered her resignation this month. Commissioners Stanley Thomas and John Pethel agreed that problems with the assessors had gone on long enough. \"Every section of the county, every taxpayer is concerned about this tax situation,\" Thomas said. Although the assessors board's chairman has promised to bring this year's digest in on time, \"we're further behind now than we have been in the last two or three years,\" Pethel said. \"I don't know how he intends to get the digest out without a chief appraiser.\" Commissioners voted to dismiss the assessors after a brief closed-door session Monday night. Commissioners also said they would vote next month on Dove's recommendation for a new chief appraiser. Before closing the meeting to the public, Commissioner Mike Youngblood pointed out that Board of Assessors Chairman David Ragland has been on the board for only seven months. Assessors Jim Escoe and Larry Stewart, who were appointed by commissioners in August 2005, attended Monday's meeting. Ragland and board Vice Chairwoman Samantha Garland, who was appointed in April 2004, were not there. Escoe said after the meeting he's approached commissioners at least a couple of times to explain the problems in the tax office, but he's been ignored. \"They don't want to know what the problem is,\" he said. \"They think the problem exists in everything.\" The assessors don't plan on backing down by resigning, and Escoe said he would take his case to a judge. \"I relish this; I want this,\" he said. \"Now we can go and get this out in the public.\"",

Julius Anton Givens was arraigned at the Henderson County Jail Tuesday morning, with bond set at $50,000 on the sexual assault charge and $2,000 on a charge of theft of property. Athens Police Department reports state Sgt. Brett Morman, Officers Ron McCurry and Chad Walker and Investigator Bill Carlow were dispatched at 1:24 p.m. to a residence where Givens had been located. Detective Sgt. Don Yarbrough said Givens was arrested without incident. Yarbrough said the victim of the assault was a female, and that the charge stemmed from a February 28 incident. On March 9, APD received a call from a family member reporting the teen-age girl had been assaulted. The case was turned over to Carlow who spoke with family members and the victim. Yarbrough said few details of the alleged sexual assault could be released due to the ongoing investigation and the nature of the offense.",

    "text": "County lifts burn ban. The Henderson County Commissioners Court lifted the five-week-old burn ban Tuesday. With the threat of wildfires greatly reduced by heavy rains, commissioners unanimously voted for an end to the ban. County Fire Marshal John Holcomb presented the commissioners with the latest information from the Texas Forest Service, showing the county in the blue category on the Keetch-Byrum Drought Index indicating ample moisture in the soil. According to Athens Review rainfall records, about seven inches fell last week. \u201cI make a motion to lift the burn ban immediately,\u201d Precinct 3 Commissioner Ronny Lawrence said. County Judge David Holstein noted that the ban, which had been in effect since February 11, was lifted as of 9:45 a.m.In other action, commissioners voted 3-2 to deny a request from Pct. 4 Constable Rick Stewart for a larger patrol vehicle, but left the door open to discuss the issue during budget talks beginning in June. Stewart told commissioners in January that he had difficulty exiting his Chevrolet Impala patrol car during an incident in Frankston in which he fatally shot 29-year-old Jason Jermaine Cumby of Athens. He asked for a larger car or a Chevrolet S-10 pick-up. Pct. 4 Commissioner Jerry West made the motion to approve Stewart\u2019s request. \u201cI felt that it needed to be addressed because of the situation in Frankston,\u201d West said. Pct. 1 Commissioner Joe Hall seconded West\u2019s motion. \u201cBig guys do have a major problem when they get in and out of some of these cars,\u201d Hall said. \u201cSome of these vehicles they drive, I couldn\u2019t drive them.\u201d Pct. 2 Commissioner Wade McKinney objected to make the change so close to the beginning of work on the 2010 budget. \u201cI know we\u2019re asking a great deal of them by not doing it, but I\u2019m looking to the coming budget year,\u201d McKinney said. West said Stewart and others had asked for larger vehicles in past budget sessions without success. West and Hall voted in favor of allowing Stewart to get a new vehicle. McKinney, Holstein and Pct. 3 Commissioner Ronny Lawrence were opposed. On other agenda items, commissioners approved: a contract to be presented by the Henderson County Sheriff\u2019s Department to other counties for the purposes of housing out-of-county inmates in the Henderson County Jail; a contract with Marex group for software to be used for digitizing court records dating from 1950; a contract with Diminsion Imaging to scan the records; a 2008 bill from Templeton Construction for work on the jail in the amount of $34,070.05 (the vote was 4-1 with McKinney opposed); and bills from 2009 in the amount of $564,740.07.",

Sales tax revenue is down, but officials say budget is still \u2018in line\u2019 The Athens City Council was given a budget update on Wednesday morning. \u201cIt is no surprise sales tax was down,\u201d Director of Finance David Hopkins said at the special session. Hopkins said sales tax revenues were down 6.86 percent from last year. He said revenues are down 5 percent overall from last year. Hopkins said the city has saved money in other areas to help balance the budget. It saved $15,000 to $20,000 on its health insurance premiums, lower gas prices and attrition, according to Hopkins. \u201cEverything else is pretty much in line,\u201d he said. \u201cThe one bright spot is the hotel/motel tax.\u201d The occupancy tax revenues have increased about $10,000 over last year. He said the revenues have been trending downward over the last two months. Hopkins said the city has about $400,000 in reserves if needed. The council also discussed:\u00e2 \u00a2 canceling the May 9 City of Athens general elections. City Administrator Pam Burton said only Mayor Randy Daniel and Councilmember Place 1 Jerry Don Vaught filed for the two available seats. Since the law allowing entities without a contested race to cancel elections went into effect in 1996, Athens has had few contested municipal races. Elections were canceled in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007 and 2008. \u00e2 \u00a2 authorizing a contract with Brinkley Sargent Architects for a facility needs study. The council voted on Jan. 13 to put the matter on hold for 60 days. Burton said at the time the council should wait to see what the economic conditions would be before committing to spending the $39,500. \u201cAs you can tell there has not been any positive change,\u201d Burton said. Athens Mayor Randy Daniel said caution is advised at this time of the budget year.",

    "text": "Area woman sentenced for mortgage fraud. CORSICANA \u2014 A Henderson County woman was sentenced to 99 years in prison for her role in a mortgage fraud scheme on Monday. On March 17, a Navarro County jury found the defendant, Kandace Yancy Marriott, 52, of Gun Barrel City, guilty of engaging in organized criminal activity. According to prosecutors, evidence presented at the punishment stage showed Marriott received monthly mortgage payments from her clients, failed to remit those payments to the mortgage lender, embezzled the homeowners\u2019 funds, and therefore caused her clients to default on their home loans. Marriott\u2019s conviction stems from her involvement in a complex mortgage fraud scheme that defrauded the federal government. The scheme\u2019s principal operators were the defendant and her husband, Darrell L. Marriott, 54, who sold manufactured homes through their company, One Way Home & Land. However, the defendants\u2019 daughter, Kally Marriott, and Mrs. Marriott\u2019s sister, Karen Hayes, have also been indicted for their role in the scheme. All four defendants face separate charges for related criminal conduct in Kaufman County. According to state investigators, the defendants illegally forged home buyers\u2019 signatures, inaccurately completed loan applications, and falsified supporting documents, including the buyers\u2019 rent payment verification statements, proof of employment, and Social Security Administration benefits data, among other items. Court documents filed by the state indicate that the defendants conduct was intended to ensure that unqualified home buyers loans were approved by mortgage lenders. The scheme involved predominantly low-income purchasers whose residential loans were guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. As a result, when the unqualified buyers defaulted on their home loans, their mortgage lenders did not suffer financial losses. Instead, HUD \u2014 and therefore the taxpayers \u2014 had to cover the default costs. Investigators believe the defendants\u2019 scheme cost the taxpayers more than $3 million. The defendants closed the One Way Home & Land after litigation and investigations ensued in late 2005. As a result, they opened a Kaufman County firm under the assumed name, Torenia. Additional criminal charges in Kaufman County stem from the defendants\u2019 Torenia operation. The Office of the Attorney General received assistance from the Navarro County Criminal District Attorney\u2019s Office, Corsicana Police Department and HUD Office of Inspector General. Attorney General Abbott\u2019s Criminal Prosecutions Division is leading the prosecution of the four defendants with the cooperation of district attorneys\u2019 offices in Navarro, Henderson and Ellis counties. For more information on Attorney General Abbott\u2019s efforts to crack down on mortgage fraud, contact the Office of the Attorney General at (800) 252-8011 or visit the agency\u2019s Web site at www.texasattorneygeneral.gov.",

    "text": "City schools look at alternative calendar. Building capacity can be maximized through having balanced calendars. Rigell said students could be split into groups, with different groups being in class at different times - for example, three groups can be in session at one time while one group is on vacation. If overcrowding became a major issue, Rigell said this could solve it in a more cost-effective manner than adding to an existing school or building a new one. Rigell said he would poll other school systems that currently have balanced calendars to see how they have implemented them. He will also poll systems that have had balanced calendars in the past and dropped them to see what shortcomings they found. That information will be presented to the Board as it is collected. Bevins said he could check with McMinn County School Board Chairwoman Pat Chester to see if the county has interest in exploring an alternative calendar. More than 10 years ago, a task force was appointed from among the county's three public school systems - Athens, McMinn County and Etowah - to study that possibility but no changes resulted.",

Police reports from Nashville describe a poor quality video showing a black man wearing a blue shirt first break into a truck before hooking it up to a red cargo trailer and driving away. He cut a lock on the front gate where the truck and trailer were being stored and drove off into the night. Carver responded and determined that it was the truck stolen in Nashville. However, the trailer and its contents were nowhere around. Metro Nashville police records state the trailer is painted red, 40 feet long, with the word \"Hyundai\" painted its on sides.

    "text": "Area funeral director charged in robberies. An Alton funeral director has been charged with robbing two Indiana banks of more than $10,000. Vanderburgh, Ind., County prosecutors last week charged George R, Chesnut with robbing Evansville Federal Credit Union on Dec. 5. The 46-year-old Chesnut was already in custody for allegedly robbing the First Bank of Princeton on March 6. Employees at First Bank told police that a man approached the counter at 4:45 p.m. wearing a baseball cap, a gray hooded jacket, blue jeans and white shoes and lifted his jacket to show the butt of a handgun tucked into his waistband, according to a search warrant. The warrant was filed Tuesday in Madison County for Chesnut's home in the 2400 block of Gillis Street in Alton. The man passed an index card to the teller which read \"This a robbery. I have a gun. Do not call Police. Give me your hundreds, fifties and twenties. \"An off-duty police officer stopped Chesnut's Ford Mustang, bearing Illinois license plates, a short while later. The officer traced the plates to the Gillis Street address. He found $4,470 in a bag inside the engine compartment, according to an affidavit filed with the search warrant. Chesnut matched the description of a suspect in the Dec. 5 bank robbery in which a man wearing a dark hooded jacket entered the bank and showed the teller the butt of his gun and demanded cash. Three tellers were working at the time, and the man approached her window speaking on a cell phone, according to a Vanderburgh County Sheriff's report. A teller gave him $5,800, according to the affidavit. The teller later picked Chesnut out of a police lineup, according to the report. On March 7, FBI agents searched Chesnut's home. They seized bank statements, collection notices, credit reports and bank notices that indicated that his Godfrey funeral business was struggling, according to the return.",

    "text": "Keeping track of every dollar. NOTICE: This is the final article in a series that looks back over the past couple of years at the accomplishments of the District 7 Board of Education and ahead to the anticipated challenges it faces. The day-to-day business operations, the working relationships with government entities and officials, and the financing of the school district are all critically important areas and the focus of today\u2019s final article. When in April, 2007, taxpayers approved the $58.3 million referendum to build Albert Cassens Elementary, Goshen Elementary and make major renovations to EHS South and Glen Carbon Elementary, and convert the Alternative School to the new Worden Elementary, the Board of Education made some commitments to taxpayers that Edwardsville District 7 Superintendent Ed Hightower noted as two important financial achievements. \u201cDuring the campaign, the Board of Education made a promise that the tax rate would not change, and as a matter of fact, it dropped slightly,\u201d Hightower said. \u201cThat\u2019s been accomplished.\u201d Hightower pointed out that the second promise the Board of Education had made was that the building bond component of the district\u2019s tax rate would remain consistent for the 20 year term to payoff the $58.3 million. The board assured that the building bond rate would not increase or would be less from the then current rate of approximately .58. The current rate is at approximately .54 which Hightower noted as a second achievement. Hightower emphasized that the bond rate was at this lower rate due to conservative planning in regards to estimating the Equalized Assessed Valuation (EAV). The State of Illinois\u2019 Web site defines the EAV as \u201cthe result of applying the state equalization factor to the assessed value of a parcel of property. Tax bills are then calculated by multiplying the EAV (after any deductions for homesteads) by the tax rate.\u201d Although the district had seen EAV growth rates averaging between 11 and 12 percent, the board estimated a rate much lower to be conservative. The EAV growth rate is estimated at 8.5 percent for the 2008 levy but future years will be even lower. \u201cThe 2009 levy for the 2010-11 fiscal year will be at 7 percent and continue thereafter for the life of the bonds,\u201d Hightower said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty conservative. That\u2019s all built in.\u201d \u201cWhen we set the 20 year issue up, we tried to be conservative,\u201d Assistant Superintendent of Business Operations Dave Courtney said. \u201cAfter the first couple of years, we had done an estimate on EAV that was at 7 percent rather than the 10, 11, 12, 13 percent that we were seeing before.\u201d Courtney noted that by using the 7 percent figure \u201cwe were able to maintain a consistent rate on the entire 20 year term.\u201d While speaking about financing, the topic of the district\u2019s loss of revenue arose. When asked about the $1.5 million loss of revenue to the school district as the result of TIFs (Tax Increment Financing) as suggested by mayoral candidate Wesley Tippit in his door-to-door campaigning, Hightower emphatically responded, \u201cLet me just say that. . . it is misleading and it is totally inaccurate. It\u2019s nowhere near $1.5 million dollars.\u201d The City of Edwardsville currently has three TIF districts: TIF I and TIF II in the downtown area, and TIF III at Gateway Commerce Center. The Edwardsville City Council approved in 2008 a fourth TIF plan for an area in downtown Edwardsville from the intersection of East College to the intersection of Illinois Route 159 and Old Alton Edwardsville Road. To illustrate his point, Hightower went on to explain that Courtney estimated a loss of only $66,000 for TIF I and about $54,000 for TIF II. In addition, Courtney provided estimates of losses to TIF III at approximately $127,000 and TIF IV is currently at about $3,000. Hightower also felt the TIFs provided numerous benefits. \u201cWhen you look at what has happened there (downtown) in the last 20 years,\u201d Hightower said. \u201cLook at the development, look at the number of improvements that have been made and the number of people employed. That is adding a benefit to this community.\u201d \u201cIt is so unfair that the school district would be used in this type of a campaign \u2013 it\u2019s untrue,\" Hightower said. \" When you consider all of the improvements that have been made and you ask yourself the question, \u2018Has the quality of life improved? Has economic development improved in this area?\u2019 The answer would be yes.\u201d Another accomplishment of the board was its role in the construction of Governors\u2019 Parkway from 157 to District Drive and Glen Crossing Road in Glen Carbon. Hightower stated that extending Governors\u2019 Parkway allowed 30 to 35 percent of the traffic to be diverted off of Goshen Road in addition to providing Vicksburg residents with another exit onto Governors\u2019 Parkway. He said that the new road allowed for a reduction in bus transportation in that area which was a savings to the district and that the new road improves traffic flow throughout the city of Edwardsville. He also noted that the completed extension would soon allow for travel from 157 all the way to 143 near the Interstate 55 entrance ramp. Hightower attributed the success of this project to a collaboration of many key individuals. \u201cMayor Gary Niebur has done an incredible job of leading and working collaboratively with the school district and Representative Jay Hoffman in getting the millions of dollars to complete Governors\u2019 Parkway from 157 all the way to 143,\u201d Hightower said. \u201cWithout collaboration, without working together, this could not have been done, and a great deal of credit goes to Mayor Gary Niebur and city officials for their hard work in getting this done.\u201d According to Hightower, the same group effort occurred in Glen Carbon in getting Glen Crossing complete. \u201cWe were able to work collaboratively with Mayor Jackstadt, the village trustees and Representative Hoffman was able to bring that money to the area,\u201d he said. Noting that phase one of the project had been in the Village of Glen Carbon\u2019s budget, but phase two was not, Hightower added that, \u201cIf Goshen Elementary School, if Cassens Elementary School would not have been part of the two road construction projects, that money would not have been filtered to this area as expeditiously as it was.\u201d Looking ahead at the challenges the Board of Education will face in the next two years, Hightower said that the major challenge is \u201cthe uncertainty at the state level and the impact that the national economy is having.\u201d \u201cThe number two challenge will be, financially, that we keep focus, live within our means, and not be tempted to use our reserves as our primary bridge for funding day to day operations of the school district,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must continue to hold the line, be fiscally responsible and do everything that we can to not impact student learning.\u201d He further stated that the goals would be \u201dkeeping class sizes where they are currently, not cutting teachers, keeping employees to the extent that we can, intact, and maintaining a three-year financial plan that will guide and lead the district without having to use our reserves \u2013 other than for the unanticipated occurrences that happens in the district.\u201d Should the district be fortunate and receive stimulus funds, Hightower said that the district will be in a more stabilized position. But he also stressed that the current budget reductions to increase revenues were \u201cnot anything that any other responsible entity around the country should be doing at this time.\u201d \u201cWe have an obligation and a responsibility of running the district like it\u2019s a business with an understanding that we have an obligation to educate our students, and that we will do,\u201d Hightower said.",

    "text": "Voice of experience speaks in Maryville. It began like an ordinary Sunday worship service, but at First Baptist Church Maryville, it wasn\u2019t an ordinary Sunday. It was the first worship service in the large sanctuary since their pastor, The Rev. Dr. Fred Winters, was killed there last Sunday. The Rev. Al Meredith, senior pastor of Wedgewood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas, brought a message of hope to the congregation in Maryville in three services Sunday morning. Ten years ago, a gunman entered his church in Fort Worth and killed seven people and wounded several others. Meredith escaped harm. The differences in the church shootings, Meredith noted, were in the number killed and the fact that the one killed in Maryville was the shepherd of the flock. \u201cIf this church is going to make it, it will be by the grace of God,\u201d Meredith repeated the message he gave in interviews this week. \u201cIsaiah said, \u2018Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter. \u2019\u201dTo prevent this happening to the Maryville church, he told members Sunday, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to step up to the plate.\u201d The world is searching for hope, he said. He told of the Russian submarine tragedy when several members of the crew survived at the bottom of the sea until their oxygen ran out. Divers, who heard tapping when they reached the sub, interpreted the Morse code: \u201cIs there any hope?\u201d All of the sailors aboard the sunken submarine perished. He said as Winston Churchill lay dying, he met for a few minutes with The Rev. Billy Graham and his question for the evangelist was, \u201cIs there any hope?\u201d Graham would have told him of the heavenly hope. Meredith said he left his church in Fort Worth with the blessing of his congregation to bring the message to Maryville and to the world, \u201cIn Jesus Christ there is hope.\u201d He named several of the ones who were slain at the Fort Worth church a decade ago and told the story of Jeremiah, a young man who may have stopped the slaughter. He called the young man a \u201cbaby Christian,\u201d who faced the gunman and said, \u201cYou need Jesus Christ in your life.\u201d As the gunman turned on him, Jeremiah spread his arms and said, \u201cGo ahead \u2013 shoot me. I know where I\u2019m going \u2013 do you? Whereupon, the gunman slumped into one of the seats and turned his gun on himself. \u201cYou are what you are under pressure,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cWhat do you get when you squeeze an orange?\u201d He nodded in agreement with the response, \u201cOrange juice,\u201d and added, \u201cYou don\u2019t get Dr. Pepper.\u201d He told the congregation that they will never get over the shooting of their pastor, but they will get through it. Meredith said a church secretary lived across from the church, but wasn\u2019t at the scene of the shooting. Her husband, a law enforcement officer put out a call for all police available to go to the church, but by the time they arrived it was over. He later told Meredith that when he went into the church and saw the carnage and the spilled blood, he smelled the cordite from the bullets yet he could feel the presence of God. Later, as the investigation began, he went into the church and wondered if he had imagined that presence. He asked for a sign that he had felt the presence of God. The investigation turned up a hymnal that had stopped a bullet. \u201cThe bullet stopped at the page with the \u2018Hallelujah Chorus,\u2019\u201d Meredith said. \u201cIt pointed to the words, \u2018King of kings, Lord of lords \u2013 and he shall reign forever and ever,\u2019 and he was convinced.\u201d Meredith chose Romans 15:13 as his text Sunday. \u201cNow the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.\u201d Meredith said the verse promises hope now that everyone can receive through believing. Meredith often breaks into song during his sermons and he asked the congregation to join him in singing, \u201cIt is Well with My Soul.\u201d Mindful that the man who killed Dr. Winters approached the pulpit down the center aisle, Meredith didn\u2019t hesitate to give the invitation to those wishing to accept Jesus as savior, to come down the aisle toward him and several did.",

    "text": "Safety stressed on St. Patrick's Day. St. Patrick's Day is a time for fun and celebration, but it can also turn tragic when drinking and driving are involved. The Madison County Health Department and Madison County Partnership for Community Health Motor Vehicle Committee are reminding those who do choose to drink to do so responsibly by designating a sober driver before the party begins. \u201cStatistics from the National Highway Traffic Administration show that over the past five years, 851 people lost their lives in motor vehicle crashes during the St. Patrick\u2019s Day holiday. Out of that number, 327 were killed in crashes that involved a drunk driver with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 or higher,\u201d a statement from the department says. MCHD Health Educator Jill Heuchert said the annual event is supposed to be a time to celebrate Irish heritage and to gather with friends, but that it can quickly turn deadly when alcohol is involved. \u201cIf you plan on drinking, don\u2019t rely on luck to keep you safe or to keep your out of trouble. Be responsible and take appropriate precautions,\u201d Heuchert said. The department offers these tips for party goers: Avoid drinking too much alcohol too fast. Pace yourself. Alternate with non-alcoholic drinks. Designate a sober driver before the party begins. Give that person your car keys. If you are impaired, don\u2019t even consider driving. Ask a sober friend, call a cab, or stay where you are and sleep it off. Take the impaired person\u2019s keys and never let a friend leave your sight if you think they are about to drive while under the influence. For those hosting a party: Serve lots of food, particularly high-protein dishes, and be sure to include lots of non-alcoholic beverages. Stop serving alcohol at the end of the early in the evening and begin serving coffee and dessert. Be sure all of your guests designate their drivers in advance, or help arrange ride-sharing with sober drivers. Keep the numbers for local cab companies handy and take the keys away from anyone who is thinking of driving while impaired. Never serve alcoholic beverages to individuals under 21 years of age. Persons wanting more information on alcohol or driving issues are asked to contact the Madison County Health Department at 692-7040, ext. 6086.",

    "text": "Leader of suicide group defends work. ATLANTA - A former assisted suicide network leader being prosecuted in a Georgia man's death is defending his group's practice of guiding people who want to kill themselves because they're suffering but not necessarily dying. At least three of the people known to have commited suicide through the Final Exit Network were not terminally ill. In his most extensive remarks since his arrest last month, Ted Goodwin told The Associated Press Tuesday that people with just months to live aren't the only ones who should be able to seek help committing suicide. \"These people who are terminally ill are blessed in a small way - there's a finite time for their suffering,\" said Goodwin, who stepped down as president of the network after his arrest. \"But there are many, many people who are doomed to suffer interminably for years. And why should they not receive our support as well?\" Critics within the right-to-die movement, including Dr. Jack Kevorkian, say people should be able to seek assistance ending their lives, but only from doctors and only if they're terminally ill. Georgia authorities say John Celmer, the 58-year-old man whose suicide led to charges against Goodwin and three others, was making a remarkable recovery from cancer when the group sent exit guides to his home to show him how to suffocate himself using helium tanks and a plastic hood. And police say that in 2007, the group helped an Arizona woman named Jana Van Voorhis who was depressed but not terminally ill. The third person, Kurt Perry, a suburban Chicago resident who was to have been the group's next suicide, has a debilitating neurological condition that is painful but usually not fatal. The 26-year-old said frightening breathing lapses prompted him to seek support from the network. \"Having them there with me would be a blessing and an honor,\" he said in an interview Tuesday. He was set to die Feb. 26, one day after Goodwin and the others were charged with violating Georgia's assisted suicide law. But he has since changed his mind, saying the arrests have given him new reason to live and help the group with its work. The network has drawn criticism from those who worry it isn't screening those who want to die carefully enough. \"You want to be sure before anyone is going to do anything like this that they're getting the best possible end-of-life care,\" said Dr. Timothy Quill, a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and a supporter of Oregon and Washington laws that allow doctors to help terminally ill people end their lives. Goodwin, who is not a physician and founded the group in 2004 after his father died of emphysema, says the network helped guide nearly 200 people across the country die to but never actively assisted suicide. He says he was personally involved in 39 deaths. The arrests were the result of an eight-month investigation in which an undercover agent posing as someone bent on suicide infiltrated the group, which bases its work on \"The Final Exit,\" a best-selling suicide manual by British author Derek Humphry. Goodwin would not comment on the suicide process, but disputed Georgia authorities' contention that guides held down members' hands to prevent them from removing the hoods they placed over their heads while they breathed helium. \"We do not hold hands down. We do not cause them to suffer,\" he said. \"And this will be proven in a court of law - I promise you.\" Authorities have also questioned how carefully the group, which claims 3,300 members and donors and about 100 volunteers, screened people who want to commit suicide. Goodwin says the vetting process was tightened in 2007, after questions about Van Voorhis' death. Goodwin defended the group's involvement, saying Van Voorhis suffered from other illnesses, but people who sought help after her were asked to detail their complete mental history. About 30 percent of the applications the group received each year were from mentally ill people who wanted to die because of a lost job, lost spouse or other anguish. Those applications were immediately set aside, Goodwin said. If an applicant's mental history raised a concern, which happened occasionally, one of 10 psychiatrists or psychologists working with the group visited to assess the situation. But if it didn't, Goodwin said, the applicant got help, even though the group knew its work could one day lead to prosecution. \"We believe that it is the right of every mentally competent adult to determine whether he or she is suffering,\" Goodwin said. \"We do not believe this should be left to the physicians, church leaders or politicians. This is the right of every mentally competent individual to make this decision themselves.\"",

    "text": "Sanford rejects aid after second rebuff. COLUMBIA --- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said Friday he won't spend $700 million in federal stimulus cash, an announcement unlikely to affect whether the state gets the money and one that came after the Republican was twice rebuffed by the White House in his attempts to use the cash to pay off state debt. \"We're obviously disappointed by the White House's decision, because it cuts against the notion of federalism and the idea of each state having the flexibility to act in a manner that best suits its needs,\" Mr. Sanford said. \"As a result, we will not be seeking the use of these federal funds for the way they put our state even further into an unconscionable level of debt.\" Mr. Sanford has become a prominent voice in opposing federal bailouts. He contends that stimulus money won't increase employment and will merely add to federal debt that will lead to higher taxes. On Thursday, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said she would reject nearly a third of an estimated $930 million that could flow to her state. Mr. Sanford, who is in Nevada for Air Force Reserve training, released a statement about an hour after White House budget chief Peter Orszag denied his request to use a portion of federal stimulus money to pay off school construction debt. Mr. Orszag sent Mr. Sanford a letter Friday saying the money can't be used on debt payments and instead needs to restore funding cuts from state budgets and help aid schools. One of the goals of the $787 billion stimulus package is \"to make critical investments in long-term economic growth, such as providing every child the chance for a world-class education,\" Mr. Orszag wrote. In all, South Carolina is to get about $2.8 billion in federal stimulus money over two years. The state's mayors had implored Mr. Sanford to take all the money he could, and the Republican-dominated Legislature has already made plans to spend the portion the governor balked on. In January, South Carolina had the second-highest unemployment rate in the nation and officials had to cut $1 billion from a $7 billion budget as the recession dampened revenue collections. The House last week passed a $6.6 billion budget patched together with $1 billion in stimulus cash. Mr. Sanford's anti-bailout stance was one of the things that led House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., to insert language into the bill allowing state legislators to override governors, a move that has raised constitutional concerns. Mr. Clyburn disagrees. \"For one, nobody is sidestepping the governor. The governor is taking himself out of the game,\" Mr. Clyburn said. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Hugh Leatherman, R-Florence, said taking the money over Mr. Sanford's objections raises the likelihood of a lawsuit that would delay the state's ability to use it.",

Joyce Shelby, an award-winning New York Daily News reporter who began her professional career in her hometown at the Augusta Herald, died March 19. She was 62. Keith Claussen, a longtime friend and a onetime co-worker at the former Augusta afternoon newspaper, called her \"one of the brightest, funniest, most down-to-earth people I've ever had the privilege of knowing.\" \"Joyce had a distinguished career in journalism. She taught journalism at Columbia University, but she told me her first love was being a reporter -- getting the story and making a difference in people's lives,\" Ms. Claussen said. She said Ms. Shelby, the first black reporter hired by the Herald in the late 1960s, was always popular. \"She had a wonderful, easy-going personality, and she could make connections with people,\" Ms. Claussen said. \"That's what earned her the respect of her colleagues, her friends and the people she wrote about.\" Ms. Shelby's career accomplishments were considerable, friends said. She was the editor of Georgetown University's alumni magazine from 1974-75, adjunct professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism from 1975-81 and an assistant professor there from 1981-87. She was a reporter for the New York Daily News from 1987 until her death, according to the newspaper. Mallory Millender, a longtime Augusta educator, met Ms. Shelby at Columbia University. \"She was extremely competent in her field and respected by the students and the professors,\" Dr. Millender said. \"She was also well-liked and a fun person. She liked to joke. \"At the same time, she was a very real person. Even if you didn't know her, the first time you met her she treated you as if she'd known you all her life.\" Ms. Shelby is survived by her mother, Prudence Young, formerly of Augusta; and her children, Gail Shelby and Clayborn Shelby III, both of New York City.",

    "text": "Shooting staged as cover, police say. The wounding of a Columbia County woman charged in the beating death of a neighbor was staged to distract law enforcement, Richmond County investigators said Monday. Sheriff's Lt. Scott Peebles also said his department plans to submit its evidence to the district attorney for possible indictment. Authorities said Rebecca Sears, 41, of Grovetown, planned to have her son, Christopher Sean Bowers, 19, of Martinez, threaten her with a gun Thursday night as she left her job at Healing Hands Physical Therapy on Augusta's Highland Avenue. Ms. Sears was supposed to be on the phone with a co-worker at the time, according to sheriff's Sgt. Blaise Dresser. Instead, the son fired the gun, wounding his mother in the leg, Sgt. Dresser said. Ms. Sears told police a strange man appeared from the bushes as she left work, shot her in the leg, then said if she \"didn't have his money it would be her face,\" according to a Richmond County sheriff's report. \"She wasn't real happy about getting shot,\" Sgt. Dresser said Monday. Ms. Sears and Mr. Bowers are now both charged with murder in the brutal beating of Katherine \"Kay\" Parsons, 41, who was Ms. Sears' neighbor on Hot Springs Drive, as well as a co-worker. Last week, authorities said Mrs. Parsons appeared to have interrupted a burglary at her home, but sources familiar with the investigation said they now believe burglary was not a motive in her death. So far police have refused to discuss what prompted the fatal beating. On Monday, both Ms. Sears, of 227 Hot Springs Drive, and Mr. Bowers, of the 4000 block of Briarwood Drive, faced Magistrate Judge Dale Jenereaux via videoconference to hear the charges against them. Although both are also charged with murder, conspiracy allegations might be withdrawn, the magistrate said. According to arrest warrants filed with the court, authorities allege that Ms. Sears and Mr. Bowers killed Mrs. Parsons between 6:50 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. Wednesday after she returned home from taking her son to school. A deputy was called to her home when a contractor discovered a smashed-in door, and found Mrs. Parsons lying in the garage near a baseball bat and claw hammer believed to have been used in the attack. Staff Writers Sandy Hodson and Adam Folk contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Woman wasn't kidnapped, now is charged in robbery. A Harlem woman initially identified as a kidnapping victim is now in jail, accused of participating in an armed robbery. Shashawna Diane Odell, 27, of the 500 block of Lou Lane, was charged with robbery, tampering with evidence and hindering the apprehension/punishent of a criminal. She was held without bond Monday in the Columbia County Detention Center, according to jail records. Police said her boyfriend Christopher Grier, of the 700 block of Knox Road in Harlem, is suspected in the armed robbery Friday of two individuals in their Grovetown home. At first, police believed Mr. Grier committed the robbery, then kidnapped Ms. Odell and their 7-month-old son and made her drive him to Monroeville, Ala. An Amber Alert was issued for Ms. Odell and her son after she called her mother in Washington, D.C. The mother called police, saying her daughter had been kidnapped, said Investigator Scott Wheatley of the Grovetown Department of Public Safety. Police found Ms. Odell and stopped her in Newton County, Ga. After they confirmed that she and the baby were safe, Ms. Odell drove back to Harlem on Sunday. Grovetown police then questioned Ms. Odell, who admitted that she willingly drove Mr. Grier to Alabama. She also told police that she drove the getaway car for Mr. Grier as he conducted the robbery and disposed of the gun he used, Investigator Wheatley said. The gun was recovered on Kings Way in Harlem. Mr. Grier is wanted for the robbery, but the kidnapping warrants have been dropped, Columbia County sheriff's Capt. Steve Morris said.",

    "text": "Statewide 211 could reach more poor. ATLANTA - Regional 2-1-1, a dialing code linking needy Georgia residents with everything from food pantries to social services, could begin expanding statewide by the end of the year, United Way officials said. If approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission, the expansion would stretch the service to 69 currently unserved counties. Those include several rural counties, among the hardest-hit by foreclosure and unemployment in the state. \"You want folks to be able to have access to information that helps them address basic needs - and you want them to be able to access that information wherever they live in the state,\" said Milton J. Little Jr., president of United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta, which initiated the exchange in 1997 and is leading efforts to expand statewide. United Way officials hope to submit a proposal to the commission by the end of the year. Right now, 2-1-1 callers are connected with operators at one of 11 call centers serving metropolitan regions across the state. Callers explain their needs to operators - anything from shelter after a weather catastrophe to rental assistance - who refer them to area service agencies. Organizers say the idea is to help people navigate the complex and ever-growing network of programs. It helps the needy in the most heavily populated areas of Georgia. But United Way officials have lacked the funds to expand to farther-flung areas, Little said. For them, \"resources as critical as emergency financial help to as general as where do I find a place to send my aging parents - they just don't have access,\" Little said. Expansion plans coincide with an increase in calls to the line. Operators fielded more than 370,000 calls in 2008, up from more than 336,000 in 2007. Little said some calls this time last year were for post-tornado help in the region. \"A lot of those callers now are bringing up issues related to food, clothing and shelter,\" said Little, who recently estimated 41.5 percent of Atlanta-area calls are for help with day-to-day expenses. Other states have been pushing to expand the program which United Way estimates connects 234 million people with social services. There are 29 states with full coverage, according to Linda Daily, director for 2-1-1 at United Way of America. They include Texas, where state funds cover 80 percent of the program's budget, she said. But many states are grappling with heavy shortfalls, and Daily acknowledged funding 2-1-1 could be a challenge. \"The budget is the main hurdle,\" she said, adding national United Way officials have lobbied Congress for help nationalizing the 2-1-1 program. Pending federal legislation could set aside $150 million in state 2-1-1 grant money for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and $100 million for each of fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Versions of the bill are in committee in both the House and Senate. In Georgia, a coalition of United Way agencies led by the Atlanta agency will draft a plan that outlines how to fund the expansion, including possible use of state money. It will have to be approved by the commission and later, state lawmakers.",

    "text": "Scandal-plagued Ga. pastor to be buried Saturday. ATLANTA - A former mega church leader who rose to fame with his progressive evangelical ministry only to have it crumble after a series of sex scandals will be honored in the church he helped build in suburban Atlanta. Archbishop Earl Paulk of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit at Chapel Hill Harvester Church died Sunday after a battle with cancer. He was 81. A funeral is scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday at the Cathedral in Decatur. For years the church was at the forefront of many social movements - admitting black members in the 1960s, ordaining women and opening its doors to gays. But Paulk was dogged for decades by accusations of molestation and sexual misconduct. The most shocking revelation came in October 2007 when a court-ordered paternity test showed he was the biological father of his brother's son, D.E. Paulk, who had become head pastor of the church after the archbishop retired the previous year. Earl Paulk had sworn in an affidavit he'd never had sex with anyone but his wife, which lead to him pleading guilty to a felony charge of lying under oath. He was sentenced to 10 years' probation and a $1,000 fine. None of the Paulks could be reached for comment by The Associated Press, but D.E. Paulk issued a statement. \"Over the past 55 years, Bishop Paulk has ministered to thousands in the Atlanta area and touched the lives of countless thousands in the global community,\" he wrote. \"As the family and church mourn his death and celebrate his life, we pray for peace and closure for all who have been connected in any way to his life and ministry.\" Paulk's church, which he co-founded with his brother, Don, grew from a tiny congregation in the 1960s to a massive empire with 10,000 members, an international television ministry, a Bible college and a $12 million sanctuary on an expansive 100-acre plot in Decatur. Paulk was invited to a White House prayer breakfast by then-President Ronald Reagan, and the church was named one of former President George Bush's \"1,000 Points of Light.\" The church made national headlines in 1992 when six female members came forward saying they were brainwashed into having sexual relationships with Earl Paulk and Don Paulk and other ministers at the church. A decade later, a former church member accused Earl Paulk of molesting her when she was a child and teenager, a lawsuit that eventually was settled out of court. Then former church employee Mona Brewer sued Earl Paulk and the church, saying she had been coerced into having a long-term affair with the pastor because he told her it was her godly duty. It was her lawsuit that led to the paternity test and the felony charge. At the same time, Earl Paulk was battling prostate cancer and undergoing multiple surgeries that left him weak and unable to make much more than one appearance at the church each week. The church's membership dwindled to 1,000 - mostly due to the sexual scandals - and the flashy neo-Gothic cathedral is up for sale for $24.5 million. The church is seeking to move to a smaller venue and continue its ministry, D.E. Paulk has said. Don Paulk told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he hopes his brother will be remembered for his work in ministry rather than the scandals. \"Preachers are just like anyone else - they're a man,\" he told the newspaper.",

    "text": "Region 1 BOE approves proposed budget. FALLS VILLAGE\u2014The Region 1 Board of Education moved quickly at its Monday night meeting to approve a proposed budget for the 2009-10 fiscal year reflecting a 1.99 percent increase in spending, a decision precipitated by several revisions and budgetary workshops. However, several members of the public took issue with the budget\u2019s elimination of a custodial position and scheduling adjustment for the custodial staff. \u201cA lot of you people just don\u2019t realize what goes on in this building on a day-to-day basis,\u201d said Pete Peterson. The budget removes one position from the daytime staff of two and a half positions and transfers one of the former daytime custodians to the night shift for a total of five staff members focusing on cleaning. Peterson, who fills the half position during the day, outlined his routine responsibilities, which include cleaning the locker rooms, kitchen and cafeteria, along with performing athletic field maintenance, in addition to emergencies and repairs. On Monday, when one of the hallways flooded, Mr. Peterson was forced to tend to the situation. He stressed that if the same situation were to occur with only two custodians in the building, certain responsibilities, such as lining the fields, would fall through the cracks. With spring clean close at hand and fall cleanup looming in the future, paring down the daytime staffing creates a daunting picture for Peterson. \u201cI understand the fiscal ramifications of a budget, but I think the personnel aspect is overlooked,\u201d said Mary Wheeler, a teacher whose husband is a custodian. Speaking on behalf of her husband, who also spoke at the meeting, she explained that her family relies on the dynamic of two parents being at home during the evening hours. Wheeler is set to move from the daytime shift to working from 3 to 11 p.m. As a teacher, Wheeler recognized the board\u2019s duty to the taxpayers, but she emphasized the unfairness of significantly altering a 17-year employee\u2019s schedule without consulting him. Though the board approved the budget with a majority vote, member Gale Toensing voiced her concern with the cuts and changes to the custodial staff. \u201cI don\u2019t buy into this doing more with less,\u201d she said. She added that the board could not ignore what she characterized as substantial objections from the members of the community to the proposed reductions. The 1.99 percent increase brings the budget\u2019s total to $14,149,238. Business Manager Sam Herrick continues to negotiate for a lower health care insurance renewal rate with Anthem Blue Cross, which produced the largest increase in the budget due last year\u2019s high claim rate. The current rate is 23.63 percent higher. Board chairman Judge Manning also reported on the recent Personnel Committee\u2019s \u201creluctant acceptance\u201d of a salary freeze for Superintendent Patricia Chamberlain, per her request. During the budget process, both Herrick and high school principal Gretchen Foster also offered to forego their raises. However, Chamberlain vetoed that suggestion. With the proposed budget set, member towns\u2019 contributions to Region 1 will be impacted in various degrees. Only Cornwall and Kent will see decreases, of $119,624 and $42,474 for a total of $1,409,257 and $2,552,999, respectively. Canaan will experience the highest jump, of $223,569, to a total of $3,440,885. Salisbury will face the second largest increase, of $138,429, for a total of $3,040,398. Sharon and Falls Village would see increases of $40,995 and $35,377, for totals of $2,718,708 and $986,989, respectively. Manning and Herrick visited residents in Sharon, Cornwall and Salisbury, members of Kent\u2019s Board of Finance attended previous workshops and a meeting with the Canaan Board of Finance is scheduled for this week, thus ensuring that the Region 1 Board reviews the 1.99 percent increase directly with the member towns. Manning reported the budget has been positively received. Peterson, however, retained his doubts after the vote. \u201cThey\u2019re cutting us way, way short,\u201d he said. Before it takes effect, the proposed budget must be approved in a district-wide budget meeting. It is scheduled for March 31 at 7 p.m.",

    "text": "Connecticut lawmakers consider apologizing for slavery. HARTFORD \u2014 Connecticut legislators are considering making their state the first in New England to apologize for slavery and other racist policies of old. A legislative committee heard testimony Monday on a resolution that would issue a formal, general apology and express the General Assembly's \"profound contrition\" for the official acts that sanctioned and perpetuated slavery hundreds of years ago. The state's African-American Affairs Commission, a liaison between black communities and the government, is urging legislators to pass the resolution, which it has called \"an exercise in reconciliation\" and not an effort to determine fault for slavery. The commission's legislative analyst, Frank Sykes, told the legislature's Government Administration and Elections Committee that \"opportunities like this must be seized,\" especially in light of the \"giant stride\" the country took last November in electing its first black president, Barack Obama. \"While this is encouraging,\" Sykes said, \"it should inspire us and challenge us to continue peeling away at the layers of racial discrimination and intolerance. \"New Jersey last year became the first Northern state to apologize for slavery, and at least five other states have done so. Of Connecticut's population of 3.5 million people, about 10 percent are black, according to U.S. Census estimates for 2007. John A. Stewart, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Hartford, said he believes the differences between blacks and whites in the state stem from Connecticut's participation in slavery. Among full-time workers in the state, black men earn 70 percent of what white men earn. Black men in the state also are four times more likely than white men to live below the federal poverty line, and black children under 5 are seven times more likely than white children to live in poverty, Stewart said, citing U.S. Census data. \"Slavery has left a cultural burden on both the exploited and the exploiters that still permeates our society,\" Stewart said. The resolution says slavery was practiced in Connecticut from the 17th through 19th centuries. There were about 5,100 slaves in the colony by the mid-1770s, about 3 percent of the population at the time. In 1723, the colony passed an act creating a 9 p.m. curfew for slaves to prevent what it called the \"Disorder of Negro and Indian Servants and Slaves in the Night Season.\" Violation of the curfew was punishable by a whipping for the servant and a fine for the master. The resolution mentions how Connecticut's wealth grew as merchants participated in the Triangle Trade, which carried slaves, crops and goods among West Africa, the Caribbean and America. It also mentions how Connecticut legislators rejected emancipation bills in 1777, 1779 and 1780 and how the new state Constitution in 1818 specifically denied the right of blacks to vote. But it later mentions how Connecticut changed its ways and played a key role in abolition efforts, culminating in the outlawing of slavery in 1848. The resolution would need to be voted on by the Government Administration and Elections Committee, possibly next week, before going to the House of Representatives and then the Senate.",

    "text": "City adjusts budget for recycling, winter maintenance. TORRINGTON \u2014 City Council tentatively approved several budget changes during a meeting Wednesday, that would affect recycling and winter maintenance supplies for the 2009-10 fiscal year. Mayor Ryan Bingham proposed a reduction of $150,000 in a disposal line item, putting the funds at $1 million. Jerry Rollett, city engineer, noted that was the cost of savings from the city\u2019s decision to switch to single-stream recycling. Last week the council unanimously approved the switch to the new system, which would allow residents to combine recyclables in the same bin. The vote came with an approval to utilize USA Hauling and Recycling Inc.Along with accepting the new company, the refuse contract line item jumped from $893,000 to $1.77 million. The reason for the hike was due to the contract with USA Hauling, which was numbered at $2.06 million for the year. A combination of other line items made up for the remainder of the contract prices, he said.",

    "text": "18 residents left homless after blaze. TORRINGTON \u2014 A fire destroyed the roof of a Main Street multi-family home Tuesday, displacing the tenants and injuring some firefighters. No residents were injured. The Torrington Fire Department responded to the call of a kitchen fire around 12:30 p.m. at 775 Main St., near the intersection of Dawes Street. What initially appeared under control progressively worsened, beginning with some smoke and resulting in flames and full-brown clouds emerging from the house, officials said. A total of 18 people live in the six-apartment building, and all evacuated safely, building owner Buzz Ebner said. Firefighters battled the incident throughout the entire afternoon and were on the scene as late as 10:30 p.m. Fire Marshal Tim Tharau said the department continued to put water on the structure after 8 p.m.A rehab station was set up outside of the house for firefighters to recuperate and check their blood pressure, said Litchfield Fire Chief Jim Koser. A few firefighters sustained minor injuries, but nothing too major occurred, Tharau said. An investigation determined that the incident began in the second-floor area of the building and was caused by a kitchen stove fire, Tharau said. The fire was accidental, he said. The building separates a north and south wing through a thick concrete wall in the middle, Ebner said. Emergency access staircases are both in the back and the front, he said. The initial blaze could be seen from the sides and the rear of the house, on both the second- and third-floor levels. A cloud of brown smoke emerged in full droves and encapsulated the entire north end of the city for hours. By 6 p.m., the entire roof of the home collapsed and water was flowing down the sides of the house. Torrington firefighters called in several other companies to assist including Harwinton, Bantam, Litchfield, Winsted and all Torrington volunteer departments. Several fire engines came and went during the incident and emergency medical services, city police and hazardous material trucks were also on the scene. Residents walked down from as far as the local McDonald\u2019s to witness the commotion. During several points throughout the day spectators stopped to take pictures and watch as firefighters descended into a blaze of smoke on top of the roof. Some even watched from across the Naugatuck River in the Shop Rite parking lot. Jay Keefe, who lives down the street, said he heard the sirens of the trucks come by. When he looked out his window, he saw the smoke emerge from the three-story home. Due to the increasing smoke and the need to bring in more assistance, police and firefighters continuously pushed back the large mass of spectators, placing yellow caution tape along the side roads. At points traffic was detoured from as far down as Lois Street and nearby pedestrians were prohibited from getting too close to the action. Following the devastation, Red Cross in Waterbury provided shelter for the residents of the house, Ebner said. The building was equipped with fire insurance and some of the residents had fire insurance as part of their rent package, he said. Evan Heller, assistant fire weather program leader for the Albany-based National Weather Service, said the weather conditions on Tuesday had fire hazard potential \u2014 particularly the dry air and low humidity. \u201cWind is a factor,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThe stronger the wind the higher the potential.\u201d The early spring is considered \u201cfire weather season,\u201d he said, after the snow melts but before the leaves begin to grow again. \u201cThis is the time that things can dry out,\u201d Heller said. \u201cUsually once you leaf out, by early summer, usually that risk tends to go down.\u201d Several other fires occurred throughout the state Tuesday, including a brush fire on Center Street in Torrington, fires in Weston and a forest fire in Glastonbury. Torrington firefighters continued to work at 775 Main St., checking for and extinguishing hot spots, Torrington firefighter Edward DeLisle said Tuesday around 10 p.m. A section of Main Street still remained closed at that hour, he said.",

Mangini was transported from the scene by Life Star after firefighters cut the door and the roof from his car. Berlin police are investigating the crash. Witnesses who saw the crash or Mangini prior the crash are asked to call Officer Robert Canto at (860) 828-7080.",

CLINTON \u2014 A town couple \u2014 neighbors of First Selectman William Fritz and with no history of drug trafficking \u2014 was charged with multiple counts of selling narcotics, police said. Jeff Plancon, 52, and Lyn Plancon, 48, of 18 Sunnybrook Lane, have been selling cocaine and painkillers from their home for at least the four months town police and the state police narcotics task force have had them under investigation, police said. With no criminal history of any sort, the Plancons were \u201cflying under the radar\u201d that usually would have alerted police to their drug business, Police Chief Joseph Faughnan said. But town and state police were able to gain entry to the Plancons\u2019 trade and make multiple purchases of narcotics from them, police said. Police believe the Plancons were buying the narcotics in New Haven and then selling them to a network of Shoreline customers. Police characterized it as a fairly small operation. In a police raid at their home Thursday, the Plancons were arrested on warrants charging each with four counts of selling narcotics and one count of conspiring to sell narcotics.",

EAST HAMPTON \u2014 Police are investigating a fiery one-car crash early Thursday morning that took the life of 19-year-old Robert Kochuk of East Hampton. Police say Kochuk was driving south on North Main Street around 1:30 a.m. Thursday when he lost control of his Chevrolet S-10 pickup, veered off the left side of the road and struck a garbage can and a tree before the vehicle burst into flames. Kochuck, who did not have any passengers, was killed in the collision. Excessive speed seems to be a contributing factor in the crash, said Sgt. Michael Green of the East Hampton Police Department.

    "text": "They did so at a special meeting recently, at the request of First Selectman Jeremy J. Shingleton. Shingleton explained that he hoped to piggyback the purchase of the bathroom with a similar project in another town \u2014 Oakdale \u2014 thereby reducing the overall cost. In all, Shingleton told the board, he expects the bathroom to cost $47,837. Director of Public Works Eric Hood said the town is purchasing the prefabricated bathroom from United Concrete Products of Wallingford. \"We\u2019re trying to keep it in state,\" he told the selectmen. The bathroom will contain one men\u2019s bathroom and one women\u2019s bathroom and a storage closet in between, Hood said. Construction of the park has been a priority since Shingleton took office in November 2007. In addition to installing the restrooms, Shingleton told the selectmen crews still must complete installation of a series of trails and bocce courts at the park. That, he said, will complete the first phase of the park construction. That will be followed by a second phase, which includes installation of a pavilion. \"Once we have the pavilion in place, we have a park,\" he said. And when the work is completed, \"That will be a great picnic area,\" Shingleton added. But, he acknowledged, without the restrooms, picnickers \"can\u2019t stay there for a long time. \"Sylvester, the finance director, said town policy allows bid waivers if state or federal contract awards are being used or if the town is participating in a multi-town purchasing arrangement. Shingleton sought the waiver to take advantage of \"bid pricing obtained by another town,\" Sylvester explained.",

Instead, they say, that was just the beginning of an unfolding incident at an apartment house on Nordland Avenue. Shortly after 7 a.m., police received a complaint from a tenant about loud music, which \u201cwas disrupting his peace,\u201d coming from another apartment, Capt. Roy A. Nelson said. An officer responded and \u201che could hear the music from a couple of houses away,\u201d Nelson said. However, when the officer went to the apartment from where the music was coming, Nelson said the tenant, Brian O\u2019Connor, 38, of 20E Nordland Ave., \u201cwas cooperative and agreed to turn down the music.\u201d With that, the officer left, the captain said. But at 8:12 a.m., police were summoned back to the same address by a frantic call from a frightened tenant of the building. The woman told police that O\u2019Connor had threatened her and had damaged her property \u2014 and that he had come into her apartment without being invited in. When police, including Sgt. Edwin Kosinski, arrived at the address in response to the call, they were told O\u2019Connor had allegedly gone to another tenant\u2019s apartment first. He banged on the door and allegedly accused the first tenant of having called police, Nelson said. However, that tenant was apparently able to convince O\u2019Connor he had not called the police. So, police said, O\u2019Connor moved on to another apartment. There, he allegedly damaged the woman\u2019s wind chime and then \u201cmade entry into her apartment.\u201d Once inside, he allegedly called out, threatening the woman, police said. Frightened, \u201cthe woman hid until Mr. O\u2019Connor left and then called police,\u201d Nelson said. As police proceeded with their investigation, Sgt. Kosinski stopped a tenant and asked him if he was Brian O\u2019Connor. The man replied he was not, at which point he began advancing on Kosinski, Nelson said. However, Officer Joe DiMaruo, who knew O\u2019Connor, alerted Kosinski that the man he had questioned and who approached him was in fact O\u2019Connor. Kosinski ordered the man to back away, and when he would not, Nelson said Kosinski subdued him with minimal force. O\u2019Connor was placed under arrest; he was charged with breach of peace, threatening, attempt to commit third-degree burglary and interfering with a police officer. He was ordered held on $10,000 bond for a pending appearance in Middlesex Superior Court.",

    "text": "Ever-popular 'Mr Ice Cream' dies aged 72. CAMBRIDGE'S Mr Ice Cream, Antonio Savino, has died. Mr Savino, who was 72, was a familiar, cheerful face on the city's streets for 40 years, selling ice cream from his van on Chesterton Road, along the Backs, and at Cherry Hinton Hall. As he drove around, his van would chime the tune O Sole Mio, and his beaming smile will be remembered by thousands of people. He was born in the small village of Flumeri in southern Italy in 1936, and married the love of his life, Antonietta, in 1958. She had been living in England for four years, and the couple were both employed as domestics for a wealthy family at Kentford, near Newmarket. Later they moved to Cambridge and Mr Savino got a job at the Fitzwilliam Museum, also working as a kitchen porter. Being a tailor by trade, he took in work making and repairing suits for the Cambridge Italian community. In 1967, having saved enough money, he bought his first ice cream van and became one of the first vendors in Cambridge. In the early days his round would cover much of north Cambridge, including Arbury and Chesterton, then during the 1980s he was given a permit by the city council to have a fixed pitch at Garret Hostel Lane, along the Backs. A family spokeswoman said: \"Locals and tourists will have lovely memories of his infectious warmth and charming personality. \"He always seemed to have enough time to make his customers feel special, and a remarkable ability for remembering names as well as faces. \"We would like to thank everyone who has sent kind messages and letters since his death in Addenbrooke's Hospital a few days ago.\" His funeral will take place on Wednesday at 10am at the Church of Our Lady and The English Martyrs in Hills Road.",

Thirteen kind-hearted youngsters received awards from the High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire, Judy Pearson, for their exceptional contributions to communities across the county. Among those honoured include 17-year-olds Luke Slater and Daniel Stephen, who run a Saturday youth club for teenagers in Newmarket Road, Cambridge, called Parent Free Zone, and eight Newmarket Ranger guides who run activities for girls with special needs. Rebecca Rayner also picked up the High Sheriff Award for her tireless fundraising efforts and her work to mentor young cadets in the Huntingdon Sea Cadets. There were also awards for a leading member of the Fenzone youth council, Charlie Manders, and Robert McColl, who runs a bike repair training service in Peterborough. Mrs Pearson praised the actions of the civic-minded youngsters. \"These young people are shining lights in their communities,\" she said. \"Their selfless dedication to other people is most impressive. They have committed a huge amount of time to other people and I commend them for it.\" The awards were presented at St Ivo School, in St Ives, on Thursday, and were attended by the chief constable of Cambridgeshire police Julie Spence. The evening also saw the High Sheriff hand out more than \u00a38,700 to a variety of youth projects, including a project run by Romsey Mill, in Mill Road, Cambridge, to involve young people in volunteering at Anglesey Abbey.

The St Ives Youth Theatre, which performed at the awards evening, also picked up a grant to help it stage a musical called Tom Sawyer. There were also awards for various youth, Guide and Scouting groups across the county. \"It is a great pleasure to be able to distribute the money raised this year to so many resourceful young people who are making a difference to the lives of other young and not-so-young people in Cambridgeshire,\" Mrs Pearson added.

He aims to finish the last mile on his 80th birthday, in a few days' time. He said: \"I'm the leader of the Cambridge group of the Macular Disease Society, and I'm doing the swimming marathon to raise money for the society's work. \"I'm trying to do three miles a week, about 100 lengths a session, and I've managed to do 14 miles so far,\" Mr Wood said. \"I will be 80 in April, and my plan is to do the last part of the swim on my birthday, as a way to celebrate.\" The Macular Disease Society was set up to help sufferers of macular degeneration.

It is estimated there are more than 500,000 people with macular conditions in the UK. Mr Wood said: \"There's a constant need for funding for research to help people, and that's why I'm doing the swim. I don't know yet how much I'll raise, but I hope people will sponsor me. I have had a number of offers of sponsorship already. \"I'm finding the swimming all right at the moment, and I'm confident I'll get over the finish line.\" If anyone wants to sponsor Mr Wood's effort, they can do so by ringing him on Cambridge (01223) 264970, or emailing afbwood@uwclub.net .",

    "text": "Foreclosures, support cases locally reflect tough economic times. Statistics from the Guernsey County Common Pleas Court reflect the current economic conditions, with both foreclosures and child support cases rising sharply since last year. At of the end of February there were 99 foreclosures pending in the court, 20 more than the same time in 2008. The number of child support cases pending through the first two months of 2008 totaled 14. During the same period in 2009 that number has more than doubled to 31. Common Pleas Judge David A. Ellwood said he believes the numbers will only grow. \"I would think that would have to follow as the economy and the recession worsen,\" he said. \"Foreclosures obviously follow the economy and if people don't have jobs they clearly won't be able to pay child support. So we're going to have more child support arrearage cases. And we work with people in both of those categories. But the court is dependent on whatever cases are filed. And that's the cases that are filed right now that are increasing.\" On a brighter note, criminal cases are down from 79 in January and February 2008 to 57 this year and there are currently no domestic violence cases in court, compared to three last year. \"Other civil\" cases -- those not categorized as professional torts, product liability or other torts -- dropped as well, from 103 last year to 76. \"But here's the 800-pound gorilla still in the room,\" Ellwood said of the foreclosures and child support cases. Total cases pending in the court's general division as of Feb. 28, with 2007 number in parenthesis, are as follows: Total cases pending in the court's domestic relations division as of Feb. 28, with 2007 number in parenthesis, are as follows: The Probation Department currently supervises 240, including 218 on basic probation, nine offenders on pretrial release, four on electronic monitored house arrest and nine drug court participants. Year-to-date statistics in other probation categories include one expungement, 34 home visits, 117 drug tests performed with 30 positive results, 22 arrests. Restitution for victims of crime collected through the end of February totaled $14,599.72. Ellwood said nine community service workers logged 238.75 hours in February, and 430.75 to date in 2009. Work sites include the Guernsey County Administration Building, Guernsey County Courthouse, dog warden and prosecutor's offices and the Noble Learning Center.",

    "text": "Ohio recession: Pay cuts, fewer police. MOUNT GILEAD (AP) -- A city court won't accept new cases because it's out of paper and has no money to reorder. Elsewhere, more firefighters are accepting wage decreases to save their jobs, and administrators at another state university are freezing their pay. Public entities around Ohio are hoping gestures like these will protect them from bigger problems caused by the recession. The gestures come when there's no relief in sight for battered Ohio, whose unemployment rate has hit 8.8 percent, a two-decade high. Tax revenue is flat at best or plunging at worst as layoffs continue and residents sew up their wallets and pocketbooks. In Mount Gilead, Judge Lee McClelland, of Morrow County Municipal Court in north-central Ohio, says the court has just enough paper to handle hearing notices and other documents for pending cases. He says several county agencies have volunteered to bring their own paper in to handle their filings. The court also is switching to a four-day work week to save money. In Euclid, in the northeast, firefighters agreed to a 2-percent pay cut and less money for continuing education and retirement funds for new firefighters in exchange for no layoffs. The city already has laid off 17 jail employees and is hoping to avoid police department layoffs. In Youngstown, Mayor Jay Williams wants city employees to work four fewer hours a week, equivalent to a 10 percent pay cut, to avoid layoffs. He's also taking a 10 percent cut, or about $10,500 in wages and benefits. Youngstown State University President David Sweet, who makes about $230,000 a year, said Friday he and eight top university officials will give up their 3 percent pay raises to create a new student financial aid fund. Earlier this month, Ohio State University said it would freeze the pay of President Gordon Gee and 18 members of his management team and put the money toward student scholarships. Top administrators at Wright State University will give up raises this year and contribute to an emergency relief fund for students. In Mansfield, Richland County Sheriff Steve Sheldon is scheduled to lay off 11 employees, though grant money saved an extra three jobs that were to be cut. The police union is proposing alternatives to layoffs, including eliminating part-time or seasonal jobs first. In Columbus, city firefighters agreed to a pay freeze to avoid layoffs. Police declined the offer and were about to lose 25 newly hired recruits when Mayor Michael Coleman announced $1.25 million in federal stimulus money would save their jobs for now. But small gestures won't work in every cash-strapped city. Toledo Mayor Carty Finkbeiner says he plans in May to lay off 75 police officers, about 12 percent of the division, if the city doesn't receive $35 million in federal stimulus funds.",

    "text": "Home hit by fire a second time. BYESVILLE -- Firefighters are searching for the cause of a blaze Monday morning that heavily damaged an Indian Lake Road residence approximately 14 months after a house at that same address was destroyed by fire. A spokesperson for the Byesville Volunteer Fire Department said the cause may be electrical, but the fire remains under investigation. The fire at the home of Rose Bench, 9025 Indian Lake Road, was first reported at approximately 8 a.m. It is believed to have started in the garage under the home. The Guernsey County Sheriff's Office reported receiving multiple 911 calls advising of the blaze. Neighbors were concerned Bench may have still been inside the home. A crew from United Ambulance was reportedly the first emergency responders to arrive on scene. \"The neighbors tried to get inside, but they were unable to open the door,\" said Steve Helton of United Ambulance. \"We went around and kicked in the back door, but the smoke was already almost to the floor. \"We got as low as possible and went inside where we were able to yell for anybody inside, but there was no response,\" added Helton, who is also a Cambridge firefighter, of the effort to locate Bench. Working with Helton was fellow United Ambulance employee and firefighter Ron Brokaw. A dispatcher with the sheriff's office located Bench a short time later at her place of employment. Firefighters launched an initial attack on the flames through the kitchen located above the garage and then through the garage until the flames were knocked down. Providing mutual aid at the scene were firefighters from the Cambridge, Pleasant City and Lore City departments. A search of the home was conducted once the flames were under control and a recovery effort was later launched to remove salvageable items from the home. In addition to the heavy fire damage, the house sustained extensive smoke and water damage. A 2006 Dodge Dakota truck parked in the garage was also heavily damaged. No firefighters were injured fighting the fire. Firefighters cleared the scene at approximately 10:30 a.m. In January 2008, a fire at a home at that same location destroyed the residence and injured a neighbor, who later succumbed to his injuries. Neighbors reported construction to replace the home had just recently finished. The American Red Cross Disaster Team responded to the scene to assist Bench, according to Caroline Johnson, chapter office manager. Sheetz in Cambridge also provided coffee and donuts for firefighters and emergency responders at the scene.",

    "text": "Special ed group criticizes Ohio governor's budget . COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Gov. Ted Strickland's budget proposal shortchanges special education by using a faulty funding formula, cutting vital programs and relying too heavily on one-time federal stimulus money, advocates said. Strickland's education funding model doesn't account for the cost of additional teacher time needed to instruct children with learning disabilities, the Ohio Coalition for the Education of Children with Disabilities said in a letter sent Monday to the Strickland administration and state lawmakers. Strickland's two-year budget proposal cuts all budget earmarks \u2014 including a $1.5 million program to mentor parents of special needs students. It replaces a significant share of the state's funding responsibility for special education with federal economic stimulus money, an apparent violation of federal mandates that would require a waiver, said coalition Executive Director Margaret Burley. \"I'm still puzzled,\" Burley said Friday. \"There seems to be a big emphasis on early childhood learning but not for children with disabilities.\" The Strickland administration has acknowledged that the funding formula is a problem that needs to be resolved. \"Quite frankly, we believe this is a valid criticism of the proposal,\" said John Stanford, Strickland's education adviser. \"We are still in conversation with the coalition about the issue.\" Both Burley and state Rep. Ron Amstutz, the ranking Republican on the House Finance and Appropriations Committee, said it has been difficult to get information about the school funding formula from the Strickland administration. \"People are allowed to make mistakes. We just want them to get corrected,\" said Burley, who's optimistic the formula will be revised. The state is spending $470.5 million in the fiscal year ending in June on special education funding \u2014 all state money. Strickland has proposed an increase of $56 million for the next fiscal year, but the state's share of the funding would drop to 58 percent because of the federal stimulus money. This would appear to require a waiver from the federal government because the state is generally required to maintain its funding for special education, Amstutz and Burley said. Stanford said the federal government has not yet given clearance for the state's proposed use of stimulus money. \"We will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Education to make sure that the program that we have developed in the state of Ohio is compliant with all federal rules,\" he said. Advocates and Republican lawmakers are also concerned that the reliance on federal money would create funding gaps in the future. \"I think we owe it to them to look further than the next meal of federal funds because we don't have any reason to expect that to continue,\" said Amstutz, of Wooster. Burley said the special education community also continues to be upset about what has been a longtime defect in allocating money to programs. The funding model assumes a base teacher salary for preschool special education of $17,500 \u2014 the figure that was pertinent in 1989. Strickland's new \"evidence-based\" funding model for all education assumes an average teacher salary of about $45,000. Burley said the lagging salary number for preschool special education has decreased the share of state spending over time, forcing local districts to make up the difference. \"Preschool kids are where we can make the most gains,\" Burley said. \"The evidence shows they are ready to learn and we have to give them the building blocks they need to continue their education.\"",

    "text": "Killer asks Ohio court to delay execution . A convicted killer scheduled to die next month has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to delay his execution, alleging that a jailhouse informant committed perjury. Brett Hartmann said a motion filed Friday that he needs time to gather evidence of the alleged perjury and test other evidence he says will prove his innocence. The motion also asks the court to delay the execution to allow Hartmann time to demonstrate that Ohio's method of lethal injection is unconstitutional. He has said that it would deny him a quick and painless death as required by state law. The state Supreme Court this month denied an earlier request by Hartmann to delay his execution so he could challenge the state's execution method. Hartmann had asked for that stay to allow time for him to join a lawsuit pending in Franklin County that makes a similar challenge. Hartmann is scheduled to die April 7 for the fatal stabbing and mutilation of 46-year-old Wanda Snipes in Akron on Sept. 9, 1997. Documents and legal filings in the case refer to the inmate as Hartman, but he has said his name is Hartmann. The filing Friday said the state has repeatedly referred to the informant's testimony as critical evidence of Hartmann's guilt. The new evidence severely undermines the informant's credibility and casts doubt on the validity of the conviction, Hartmann's motion said. His motion also referred to testimony presented March 23 in a federal trial in Ohio that is part of another condemned inmate's challenge to the lethal injection process. The judge in the federal case is taking testimony from Ohio's execution team to determine whether condemned killer Kenneth Biros can prove he has a chance of making a successful argument against injection in a longer and more detailed trial. Hartmann's motion said testimony given in the federal court case provided evidence to demonstrate that Ohio's execution method carries \"substantial risk of harm, i.e. excruciating pain during the execution.\" It would be \"particularly unfair and inhumane\" to execute Hartmann within days of the first time that testimony became available to him and to the public, Hartmann's motion said. Hartmann has said he must be given the same opportunity as other death row inmates to challenge the constitutionality of Ohio's execution method.",
