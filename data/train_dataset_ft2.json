    "text": "Taxing cow flatulence? It could happen if emission fees approved. That's what two Republican state lawmakers fear will happen if federal officials move forward with plans to charge fees to farmers for livestock emissions. Sens. Tim Grendell, from Chesterland, and Bob Gibbs, from Lakeville, have introduced a resolution in the Ohio Senate urging quick passage of federal legislation exempting livestock from Clean Air Act fees. The resolution stems from a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled greenhouse gases are considered pollutants under the Clean Air Act. As such, entities with emissions of more than 100 tons per year would have to obtain the proper permits. It would take 25 dairy cows, 50 beef cattle, 200 hogs or 200 sheep to produce that amount of emissions, Grendell said. The two lawmakers, citing statistics compiled by the American Farm Bureau Federation, said the resulting Clean Air fees on livestock producers would range from $22 a head for hogs to $175 per head for dairy cows. \"I believe everyone understood those gases to be industrial gases and not gases produced by livestock,\" Grendell told reporters Wednesday. \"And in fact I would submit that before we should put a tax on gas produced by livestock, we would have to impose a tax on those who use Taco Bell.\" Their resolution, a symbolic gesture showing the state's stance on the issue, urges the Environmental Protection Agency not to implement new regulations on livestock producers, nor impose new fees on farmers for animals' emissions. \"The Clean Air Act was adopted to regulate and prevent air pollution from smokestack industries,\" Gibbs later testified before the Senate's natural resources committee.",

SOUTH CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Restaurateur Bill Sohovich is giving Southridge another go, but this time he's opening slowly and more deliberately. Billy's opened and closed at Southridge over about a four-month period last year. \"We made some mistakes and we know we did,\" Sohovich said. \"My daughter and I and my wife analyzed these. We're starting over again up there. We're starting very slowly, to get our feet on the ground.\" Sohovich owns Soho's in Capitol Market and Blossom Deli downtown. The short-lived Billy's served comfort food - items like chicken and dumplings and meatloaf. \"From the time we closed we've gotten all kinds of feedback,\" Sohovich said. \"The common thread was, people wanted a little bit better food up there. They expect more from Bill Sohovich than home-cooked food.\" The new venture, Billy's Soho's @ Southridge, opened about two weeks ago. It is in the former Smokey Bones location near Olive Garden. \"What we're doing now is, we're going to keep some of the old and bring some new in,\" Sohovich said. \"We'll broaden our menu. We have trout, oysters Rockefeller and some fillets. We've kept some of the Billy's favorites - chicken and dumplings, meatloaf and ribs. \"Every day we're adding new menu items,\" he said. \"By the middle of next week we should have everything we're going to serve on the menu available. We want to take it one day, one step at a time, and make sure our feet are firmly planted on the ground.\" \"We got away from lunch,\" he said. \"We're going to concentrate on the dinner entree business and the sports bar aspect. We have a full bar and an upgraded wine list.\" The restaurant is open from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday, noon to 10 p.m. Saturday; and noon to 9 p.m. Sunday. \"Absolutely great people who worked there before are in there now helping me,\" Sohovich said. He praised his bankers, United Bank Charleston Market President Julie Gurtis and her assistant, David Mills, as well as his Southridge landlord, Lee Rashid. \"These people have made it possible with the financing, the rent - they've given me the opportunity to get this restaurant back up and running,\" Sohovich said. \"They're truly trying to help me put everything back together. \"Every one of the purveyors has been a gentleman and has been working with me,\" he added. \"I could have taken Billy's into bankruptcy. But I live in this community. I am a man of my word. These people are going to get paid back.\"",

    "text": "Mound Center set to open in S.C. today. SOUTH CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Photographs of artifacts taken from the Creel Burial Mound in South Charleston now have a permanent home at the new Mound Interpretive Center next to the LaBelle Theater in South Charleston. The new center will open to the public at 11 a.m. today after nearly five years of work and research by South Charleston officials and community leaders. \"Joe Mays was on city council and did the ground work to get this going,\" said Ben Paul, chairman of the center committee. The completion of the center was made possible through a $300,000-plus grant from the West Virginia Division of Highways, and the city added $80,000. The city-owned building was renovated by the public works department and designed by designminds, which planned and created the interpretive displays in the center. Along with the mound display and Native American artifacts, a portion of the center is devoted to the Midland Trail. Alice Hypes, executive director of the Midland Trail National Scenic Highway, represents the 180 miles of the trail in West Virginia. \"We're very excited about the exhibit,\" she said. \"Folks that come into the center can push a button and find out about the whole trail, which is one of the oldest in the country.\" In fact, Hypes said George Washington designed the original trail from Virginia Beach, Va., to Cedar Grove in 1790. Visitors to the center can discover the interesting points along the trail from Cabell County to Bluefield by selecting one of nine buttons that initiates an audio interpretation of a specific area along the trail. In addition to the Mound and Midland Trail sections of the center, there are displays of Blenko Glass and items from Union Carbide when it was in its heyday. The mound portion of the center focuses on the Adena Culture that built the mounds in the area. At one time there were more than 50 earthen mounds built by these Native Americans in our area from St. Albans to Kanawha City. Today, only three remain. One is located behind Sunset Memorial Park in South Charleston while another is at Shawnee Park in Institute. The largest remaining one is the South Charleston Mound, which is estimated to have been built between 250 and 100 B.C. \"This is the first time in 125 years that people can see what artifacts were discovered in the mound,\" said Mayor Mullins. \"We hope this center provides the public with a good image of the history of our area.\" Mullins also said he wants school groups to be a part of the center's programs by visiting and taking part in activities planned for the future. \"We want this center to be open to all, from individuals to schools, seniors, church groups and college students,\" he said. \"We hope that anyone who's interested in the history of the area will find the center exciting, enjoyable and educational.\" A large relief map of the three mounds still in the Kanawha Valley along with a wall map marked to indicate their location is also audio equipped. The display also shows a half-portion of a mound where visitors to the center can see what the Adena people buried in their mounds. A back hallway of the center is lined with pictures of the artifacts excavated in the 1800s by the Smithsonian Institution. Darla Spencer, a member of the West Virginia Council for Archaeology as well as the Native American History Council, took the pictures. The photos show necklaces of ocean shells that were made by the Adena people and fish darts, arrowheads, mussel shells, projectile points, stone disks and more. The Adena people were the first in this region to settle down in small villages, cultivate crops, use pottery vessels, acquire exotic raw materials, such as copper and marine shells to make ornaments and jewelry and to bury their honored dead in burial mounds. The period of the Adena's existence is estimated from 500 BC to 1000 AD. Mary Ann Wade and Gloria Shirkey will be operating the center and be available to answer any questions visitors might have. \"At least we hope so,\" said Wade. \"We also have a video or sound library of 13 CDs of historical artifacts of the city of South Charleston that we can play for visitors too.\" When the center opens Friday, there will be a group of school children from South Charleston among the first visitors. \"We hope that kids will utilize the center at every opportunity,\" said Mayor Mullins. \"It's the community's place now and we hope folks will visit often.\" The Mound Interpretive Center is on D Street in South Charleston and will be open to the public from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday.",

Charleston police were called Tuesday to a report of a disturbance at the Knights Inn motel on MacCorkle Avenue in Kanawha City. A man there, identified as Rick Smith, told police he'd been trying to break up a fight between Jason Terrell Jones, 23, of Central Avenue and Jones' girlfriend, who was not identified, according to a complaint filed in Kanawha Magistrate Court. Witnesses told police Jones got upset, went into the motel room where he was staying, retrieved a gun and put it to Smith's head, the complaint said. Jones fled on foot when officers arrived but was picked up a short distance away, according to the complaint. Police wrote in the complaint that they found a gun in a creek bed along the route Jones took to evade arrest. While searching Jones at police headquarters, officers retrieved two baggies of white rocks, believed to be crack cocaine, from Jones' underwear, the complaint said. The substance in the bags, which totaled about 8.6 grams, later tested positive as cocaine, according to the complaint. Police discovered that Jones had been convicted in 2004 of selling controlled substances in Bronx County, N.Y, which makes him ineligible to possess a gun, the complaint said. Jones was charged with brandishing, possessing a firearm when prohibited by law and possession of crack cocaine with intent to deliver.",

    "text": "New policy restricts some transfer students from playing high school sports. Kanawha County high school students will have to sit out a year of sports if they transfer from one county school to another after the start of their ninth grade year, school board members decided. At a tense and combative meeting Thursday night, the board approved the plan aimed at eliminating the recruiting of high school athletes. Board members say behavior by some coaches, boosters and parents are ruining community schools, promoting unsportsmanlike conduct and overshadowing academics. School officials are trying to correct what they said was a loophole in country policy. To get around a yearlong sports ban that applied to students who transferred from one school district to another, parents were renting apartments, moving into other family members' homes or changing custody of their children to prove they had \"moved.\" That exempted the students from the ban. After Thursday's vote, any Kanawha County student who switches high schools after the start of their ninth-grade year, for any reason, can't play sports for a year. The last chance to transfer without facing the ban is as an incoming freshman, right out of middle school. Board members signed off on the change with the caveat that they might soon consider additional restrictions, including requiring transfer students to keep a higher grade point average to play sports. The board had voted down a more stringent transfer policy earlier Thursday. That proposal would have barred any student in middle school and high school from playing sports for a year if he or she either changed schools or started as a new student in the county. It would have applied even to students who moved with their families from another county or state. Steve Hurley told the board he was recently laid off from his job at American Woodmark. He said he planned to move from Grant County to Nitro with his family to find work. \"And now, all of the sudden, the kids don't want to move because they want to play sports,\" he said. \"We're trying to move four hours to better our family and the school system says, 'No, you can't do that,'\" Hurley said. Board members Jim Crawford and Bill Raglin voted for that stricter policy. But board president Becky Jordon and board members Pete Thaw and Robin Rector voted it down. Jordon then attempted to build consensus for the compromise plan. In a 3-2 vote, the board approved the less strict policy change. Crawford and Raglin voted against it, saying it was not strong enough. Raglin specifically argued that the final policy still has too much potential for loopholes. He said students are being recruited and lured to schools to play sports and provide entertainment for fans, and then they are abandoned academically. \"I'm here to represent the concerns of the students whose parents aren't concerned,\" Raglin said. He said data given to him by Superintendent Ron Duerring show that high school athletes who transfer schools perform worse academically than other transfer students. Raglin suggested requiring a GPA of 2.5 or above for student athletes who transfer from one county school to another. The current GPA requirement is 2.0 for all student athletes. \"A 2.0 GPA guarantees one thing: consideration for a job, maybe at McDonald's,\" he said. But Kackie Eller, a guidance counselor at George Washington High School, said some of the proposed restrictions could spell \"the end of school sports as we know them.\" She said students are increasingly turning to athletic programs outside of school, especially church league basketball, to avoid confusing eligibility rules now in place. Eller raised concern that some of the proposed policy changes would punish many students because of the actions of the few. \"I don't understand why they can't just come down on the coaches,\" she said. \"The failure of this system has been our failure,\" Thaw said. \"We've allowed the overzealous coaches. We've allowed the indiscriminate boosters.\" Several board members suggested that whatever policy they adopted, they would be willing to hear appeals and grant exceptions in some cases.",

We think this could be the key that unlocks the future of how we'll be able to deal with the carbon that's coming off of existing coal-fired power plants.\" Jim Guidarini, Dow's West Virginia site leader, said the South Charleston power plant has the only coal-fired boiler owned by Dow Chemical in the United States. The power plant has three boilers -- two that burn natural gas and one that burns coal. The pilot plant will test the Alstom-Dow amine carbon capture process on the coal-fired boiler's flue gas. Work on the pad for the pilot plant began several weeks ago, Guidarini said. About 20 construction workers will be on site at the height of construction. \"We expect construction to be done in another couple of months,\" he said. The plant is expected to begin operating by the third quarter of this year. Alstom then will have five people on site to operate it. \"We expect it to run for two years,\" Guidarini said. \"It depends on what we learn. That's why we're doing a pilot -- to learn things.\" Asked about the plant's price tag, Guidarini said, \"We're not releasing any cost information on it.\" \"The way the amine process works is, you scrub the carbon dioxide out of the vent stream with the amines,\" Guidarini said. \"You have a reactive product. Then you get the carbon dioxide off and you have pure carbon dioxide. The idea going forward in large plants is, you sequester the carbon dioxide somehow. In this plant we're just testing the first piece -- how do you capture the carbon dioxide, how do you get it off the amines?\" The carbon dioxide that is captured will be released, he said. \"The problem with carbon dioxide is, it's tough to use,\" said. \"It's not very reactive. It's a hard feedstock to do anything with. You don't hear of anybody doing anything with carbon dioxide because it's tough to do. But that's something Dow in the future is certainly looking at.\" Manchin said, \"The money will be in the research to figure out what you do with the carbon. It's like when we burned coal and had refuse piles. Then they captured sulfur with a limestone spray and had another byproduct. Now they're using that byproduct to make gypsum board. There's got to be a way to solidify carbon and use it for fuel.\" The cost of removing carbon dioxide is considered an energy loss, since the energy needed for the process is subtracted from that generated by a power plant. Guidarini said Dow believes its proprietary amines technology is much less energy intensive than other processes. The pilot plant will capture about 1,800 tons of carbon dioxide a year. This is the second carbon capture project to be announced in West Virginia. The other project is much larger. Alstom, American Electric Power and German utility conglomerate RWE are building it at American Electric's Mountaineer power plant in Mason County. American Electric is investing about $76 million in the Mason County project, which is designed to capture about 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Alstom has said that research shows its technology may only cause an energy loss of 10 percent. In addition to capturing carbon dioxide, the Mason County project will chill it to a liquid using Alstom's Chilled Ammonia Process. The liquid will be permanently stored underground. American Electric is working with subcontractor Battelle Memorial Institute on the storage system. The Mason County project is expected to begin operating in September.",

    "text": "Hotel project on, Tri-State vows. CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Officials at Tri-State Racetrack & Gaming Center say they intend to proceed with a $250 million expansion project at the Kanawha County track and casino despite bad economic conditions that have hit the gambling industry particularly hard. Dan Adkins, vice president of Hartman & Tyner Inc., which owns the facility in Nitro, said he met with Gov. Joe Manchin on Thursday to talk about the track's future and assure state officials that he intended to make good on promises to build a hotel and entertainment complex at the track. \"I'm not coming with my hat off and my hand out,\" Adkins said Friday. He said he does not intend to ask state lawmakers to push back deadlines for a table-gaming referendum and the construction timetable at the track and casino. John Melton, attorney for the West Virginia Lottery Commission, said recently that the 2007 law allowing the expansion of table games requires the hotel to be up and running at Tri-State by the August 2010 deadline, not merely under construction. If Tri-State's owners fail to complete the hotel in time, they face a $2.5 million annual penalty until the hotel is open. With ground unbroken, no architect yet announced for the project and time running out, state and county officials are beginning to wonder whether Tri-State will be able to make the deadline. \"I think Tri-State has publicly committed to build a hotel, and will build it,\" said Kanawha County Commission President Kent Carper, who said he has watched the progress of Tri-State's plans closely. \"If they don't, the penalty is pretty unpleasant for them. They said they'd build it, and they need to build it,\" Carper said, but conceded that the hotel might not be finished in time to meet the deadline. \"To me, it wouldn't be the end of the world if it were delayed a year,\" he said. \"I just want to see it built.\" When the Legislature passed the law allowing local voters to approve the expansion of gambling to include table games such as poker and blackjack, the law required a vote after another five years so voters could decide if they wanted table gaming to continue. The law also required Tri-State to build a hotel. The state's other racetracks already have hotels at their facilities. Kanawha County voters approved table gaming at Tri-State Racetrack in August 2007. Carper said Adkins has had considerable trouble finding financing for the proposed $250 million expansion at Tri-State. The project includes a hotel of at least 200 rooms, a conference center and entertainment complex. \"You can't blame everything on Tri-State,\" Carper said. \"It's not their fault the economy is in the tank.\" The pain is being felt across the gambling industry. Last year, Tropicana Entertainment LLC, which runs the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, filed for bankruptcy. The company that runs Donald Trump's casino empire filed for bankruptcy in February. Herbst Gambling Inc., which operates a casino in Iowa, two more in Missouri and 12 in Nevada, announced plans to file for bankruptcy last week, according to the Des Moines Register newspaper. Carper said he was told that Adkins intended to ask state officials to push back the deadline on the table-gaming referendum to make it easier to secure financing for the project. With the referendum on table games looming, Carper said, investors or banking officials probably will be reluctant to loan a lot of money on a project that voters might decide they don't want anymore. \" [Extending the deadline] will assist them in getting financing,\" Carper said. Adkins acknowledges that times are hard and it has been tough to finance the expansion project, but he said he would not ask state officials to push back any deadlines for the track. \"We don't file bankruptcy,\" Adkins said. \"We're going to proceed with what we said we're going to do, with our own money.\" Matt Turner, spokesman for Gov. Manchin, confirmed that Adkins met with the governor Thursday to discuss \"the future of the racetrack.\" He said Manchin was \"encouraged\" by the conversation. Adkins said he hoped to pick an architect for the expansion project on Friday.",

    "text": "Obama signs protections for Mon Forest acreage. CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Lewisburg Mayor John Manchester on Monday had a bird's-eye view of President Obama signing into law a bill granting wilderness protection to more than 2 million acres of land, including 37,771 acres in the Monongahela National Forest. \"For some reason, they stuck me in the second row,\" Manchester said after the signing. \"It was a wonderful ceremony, and I got to shake the president's hand and meet a lot of the congressional leaders.\" Manchester was among about 150 supporters of various pieces of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 who were invited to attend the bill-signing ceremony at the White House. The legislation protects tracts of federally managed land in nine states, from Oregon to Virginia. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W. Va., chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and a longtime backer of the legislation, was among 13 U.S. senators and representatives in attendance, along with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. \"As Americans, we possess few blessings greater than the vast and varied landscapes that stretch the breadth of our continent,\" Obama said. The new law, he added, guarantees that Americans \"will not take our forests, rivers, oceans, national parks, monuments and wilderness areas for granted, but rather we will set them aside and guard their sanctity for everyone to share. That's something all Americans can support.\" In West Virginia, the Wild Monongahela Act, which was a component of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act, creates three new wilderness areas in the Monongahela National Forest, and adds acreage to three existing wilderness areas. The new areas are the 6,280-acre Roaring Plains West Wilderness, which abuts the existing Dolly Sods Wilderness east of Canaan Valley; the 7,142-acre Spice Run Wilderness on the east slope of the Greenbrier River Valley near the Greenbrier-Pocahontas County boundary; and the 5,242-acre Big Draft Wilderness along Anthony Creek at the extreme south end of the Monongahela near Lewisburg. The act also added 7,215 acres to the north end of the Dolly Sods Wilderness; 12,032 acres between the Williams and Cranberry rivers in the Cranberry Wilderness; and 740 acres near the Dry Fork River to the Otter Creek Wilderness. Manchester was among wilderness supporters who testified before Rahall's committee last year. \"I spoke on the value of wilderness to my community,\" he said. \"There are a lot of tourists who love to explore wild places, and as soon as these new wilderness areas are on the map, we'll have another arrow in our quiver for our marketing campaign. I expect the new wilderness areas will give the state a significant bump in its tourism base.\" Elsewhere in the nation, the act added nearly 50,000 acres of wilderness to Virginia's Jefferson National Forest, and granted wilderness protection to land along Mount Hood's northeastern slopes in Oregon, to the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan, in Utah's Zion National Park and in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.",

Kanawha County emergency responders and state highway officials don't know exactly how long W.Va. 61 will be closed in East Bank because of a mudslide. But East Bank Mayor Chuck Blair said Monday that he expects the major thoroughfare to be shut down at least two days. \"They're still trying to determine how much damage there is,\" Blair said. \"There's a deep mine up there that has been accumulating water for years and years and years,\" Petry said. Kathy Cosco, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the mine last operated in the 1940s or 1950s. Classes at East Bank Middle School were also canceled as a result of the slide. Melanie Vickers, assistant superintendent in charge of middle schools, said East Bank Middle School will be open today. Principal Candy Strader drove to the school Monday and saw no damage inside the building, according to Vickers. \"She did get inside and said things were fine,\" she said. The problem was all the water that had spilled into the school's parking lot, Vickers said. After speaking with county transportation director George Beckett, Vickers said she believed bus drivers would be able to get students to the school safely. Kanawha County emergency responders and state highway officials don't know exactly how long W.Va. 61 will be closed in East Bank because of a mudslide. But East Bank Mayor Chuck Blair said Monday that he expects the major thoroughfare to be shut down at least two days. \"They're still trying to determine how much damage there is,\" Blair said. Kanawha County Emergency Services Director Dale Petry said an old, abandoned mine that had been dormantor for years started overflowing early Monday, sending hundreds of thousands of gallons of water cascading across W.Va. 61 and onto First Avenue in East Bank and forcing tons of rock and earth onto the road near the western end of town. \"There's a deep mine up there that has been accumulating water for years and years and years,\" Petry said. Kathy Cosco, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the mine last operated in the 1940s or 1950s. Classes at East Bank Middle School were also canceled as a result of the slide. Melanie Vickers, assistant superintendent in charge of middle schools, said East Bank Middle School will be open today. Principal Candy Strader drove to the school Monday and saw no damage inside the building, according to Vickers. \"She did get inside and said things were fine,\" she said. The problem was all the water that had spilled into the school's parking lot, Vickers said. After speaking with county transportation director George Beckett, Vickers said she believed bus drivers would be able to get students to the school safely. Petry said the slide forced the evacuation of one family whose driveway was obliterated by the mass of mud and water. Stacy Auber, who lives downhill from the old mine, said relatives called her about 6:20 a.m. and told her about the mudslide. Soon, a dump truck belonging to the family went sliding over the hill. Auber grabbed some clothes and left her house by about 10:30 a.m. She was allowed to return home Monday afternoon. But Johnny Walker, a highways administrator with the state Division of Highways, said highways officials can't even begin to guess how long it will take to clear away the debris and reopen W.Va. 61. He said it all depends on how badly the tons of mud and water damaged the two-lane highway. \"We've got a piling wall along that entire section, and it's undercut all of that,\" Walker said. Highways officials need to determine whether the ground beneath the road was undermined, and they won't know that until water stops pouring across the asphalt. Petry said discharge from the mine portal had slowed down by mid-afternoon, but that water continued to gush out of the abandoned mine at a rate of about 2,000 gallons per minute. Emergency officials reopened narrow First Avenue Monday afternoon to allow residents access to their homes, but the single-lane street will be open only to passenger vehicles. Mud and water also closed the inner set of railroad tracks, Petry said. All but local traffic was being rerouted at Cabin Creek Road and Paint Creek Road. \"We're kind of on pins and needles now to see what happens next with it,\" Blair said Monday afternoon. \"We don't know how much water is up there to come out.\"",

Holroyd served various posts within the state party over the years, including as national committeewoman. \"She was always in the fray and in the thick of things,\" state party chairman Nick Casey said Monday. \"Emilie spent her entire life working tirelessly for what she believed in. This loss is not only a loss to Mercer County, but to our West Virginia Democratic Party and our entire state, as well,\" Casey said. U.S. Sens. Robert C. Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, both D-W. Va., each called Holroyd a dear friend. Byrd recalled her compelling personality and extraordinary networking skills. Rockefeller said Holroyd was a tireless volunteer and role model. Byrd said of Holroyd, \"She was a partisan out of principle, and she served her party, state and nation with intellect, passion and great good humor. She knew and worked for presidents, senators, congressmen, governors and state legislators, but she also knew county officials and poll workers and others who labor behind the scenes to get things done.\" Gov. Joe Manchin said he's never met anyone more passionate about her family, her beliefs and her community than Holroyd. \"The truth is that we did not always agree, but I have to tell you that I liked it much better when we did,\" Manchin said. \"Emilie had such strong devotion, and she was respected by all who knew her. Our thoughts go out to her husband, Bob, and the many loved ones as they go through this difficult time.\" CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Emilie Holroyd, a longtime fixture in West Virginia Democratic politics and a frequent representative of her state at the party's national conventions, has died at age 74.",

    "text": "Taco Bell killer pleads guilty. CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A Charleston man admitted in Kanawha Circuit Court on Monday that he gunned down his longtime girlfriend in a West Side Taco Bell in July 2008. Desmond Demetrius Clark, 22, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, saying he shot Na'lisha Gravely, 19, with whom he had a son. \"I shot 'Lisha in the Taco Bell,\" Clark said. \"I later learned that she died from it.\" As part of the plea deal, prosecutors agreed to drop two wanton endangerment charges and a kidnapping charge against Clark. Clark, who had a lengthy history of domestic violence against Gravely, followed her into the Patrick Street restaurant, where she had apparently fled from him during an argument. Video surveillance appeared to show Clark hopping the counter moments before he fired into the closet where Gravely was hiding. Chief Kanawha Circuit Judge Jim Stucky accepted Clark's plea, and set his sentencing for June 2. Both sides are free to call witnesses and argue whether or not Clark's life sentence should come with a recommendation of mercy, meaning that he could eventually be paroled. Clark was captured following a brief manhunt. His arrest and subsequent murder charges set off an uproar, in part because of his extensive criminal history and in part because he was subject of a domestic violence protective order taken out by Gravely when he killed her. Clark turned and quietly said \"I love you\" to his supporters before he was led out of the courtroom. Gravely's family and friends left the courtroom without talking to reporters. After the hearing, Plants said he was pleased with the conviction and that he plans to ask Stucky to send Clark to prison for the rest of his life. \"The facts of this case are just brutal. He shot her in broad daylight. He admitted it,\" Plants said. Clark told Stucky that his son now lives with Gravely's family. Defense attorney Theresa Chisolm said Clark wanted to accept responsibility for his actions. Plants said Gravely's tragic murder brought additional attention to the issue of domestic violence. \"Women who are in the cycle of abuse need to get out of the cycle,\" he said. Earlier this month, the state Supreme Court touted the launch of its electronic domestic violence registry, which gives police officers statewide electronic access to domestic violence protective orders like the one a Kanawha County Family Court judge issued to Gravely on May 28, 2008. According to that order, Clark and Gravely were not supposed to be around each other until Aug. 28, 2008, a few days after she would have turned 20. A Dunbar police officer pulled over a car driven by Clark with Gravely in the passenger seat on the day of the murder, but, apparently unaware of the protective order, he ticketed Clark for driving on a suspended license and for having a small amount of marijuana. Clark was on probation at the time, having been sentenced by Stucky to two years probation in March 2008 for felony possession with intent to distribute and several misdemeanors. The domestic violence registry is now up and running in 14 counties, but those do not yet include Kanawha County, Supreme Court administrative director Steve Canterbury said Monday. A bailiff leads Desmond Clark out of the courtroom following his guilty plea Monday. Clark admitted that he shot and killed Na'lisha Gravely, the mother of his child, in a West Side Taco Bell in 2008.",

    "text": "House rejects attempt to force vote on marriage amendment. On Monday, Republicans in the House of Delegates tried to advance a bipartisan resolution that would define marriage in the state constitution, but the Democratic majority blocked their attempts. The \"Marriage Protection Amendment\" resolution (HJR5) introduced last month calls for a statewide referendum on whether to amend the constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman. The measure has been stuck in the House Constitutional Revision Committee. On Monday, House Minority Leader Tim Armstead tried bring the resolution to the floor for a vote by moving to discharge it from committee. \"The overwhelming majority of West Virginians have let us know in no uncertain terms they want us to take action on this issue,\" the Kanawha County Republican said, adding that 30 other states have approved constitutional amendments on marriage. \"It's time for us to listen to the people we represent.\" Since 2000, West Virginia has had a Defense of Marriage Act, which bars the state from recognizing same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. But Armstead said recent events in other states dictated the state should amend its constitution. \"I think we've seen over the past few years why it's so urgent,\" he said. He pointed to legal challenges to Proposition 8 in California and the recognition of gay marriage in Massachusetts. \"This is an urgent issue,\" Armstead said. \"It's an issue that needs to be addressed. It's an issue we feel very strongly about.\" But the House voted 67-30 -- almost entirely along party lines -- to postpone Armstead's motion indefinitely, meaning the resolution can't be considered again this session. Delegates also passed a motion to cut off debate on the issue. The only comments from Democrats came from House Majority Leader Brent Boggs, D-Braxton, a sponsor of the resolution. Boggs said the legislative process had to take precedence over delegates' personal feelings on the issue. \"It's not good public policy to bypass the committee process,\" he said, reading from a prepared speech. Besides Armstead and Boggs, other sponsors of the resolution are Delegates Harold Michael, D-Hardy; Ricky Moye, D-Raleigh; John Overington, R-Berkeley; Linda Sumner, R-Raleigh; and Clif Moore, D-McDowell. Earlier this month, a telephone campaign by the Family Policy Council of West Virginia targeted House Judiciary Chairwoman Carrie Webster, D-Kanawha, and House Constitutional Revision Chairwoman Barbara Fleischauer, D-Monongalia. The council claimed the two delegates were blocking a ban on gay marriage, since their committees would have to approve the resolution. Webster, whose committee never saw the bill, said the campaign led to the harassment of her staff.",

    "text": "Funding to dry up on Friday for Charles Webb Center. The Charles Webb Center for developmentally disabled kids, which has survived on donations for nearly three months, is hoping for another miracle. The center has funding to stay open through Friday. It may be able to secure a grant this week to keep it running through April 3. The community has kept the center afloat since Jan. 1 with more than $30,000 in donations. The state Department of Disabilities and Special Needs cut $150,000 in annual funding for the center in response to a General Assembly mandate to trim $21.5 million or 11.2 percent from its budget. On the state House floor last week, Rep. Wendell Gilliard, D-Charleston, tried unsuccessfully to restore $250,000 in funding for the Webb Center and another center for developmentally disabled children in Anderson. \"They knocked it down,\" Gilliard said. \"I'm still soliciting private donations to keep the Webb Center afloat. It's an invaluable service to our children,\" he said. No one knows that better than Mindy Miller of Ravenel, whose son, Parker, 8, has Fragile X syndrome and is developmentally delayed by about three years. He has been at the Webb Center for nearly seven years. Miller and the other parents of the 30 children at the center said there is no place like it. \"You hang on to every day and hope that a miracle happens. It's kind of wearing me down. It's frustrating, an emotional roller coaster,\" Miller said. educable mentally disabled children at Drayton Hall Elementary School. After school, he takes a bus to the Webb Center on Evergreen Street, where he is picked up when his parents leave their business, Miller Signs, about 6 p.m. Several of the parents have said that if the Webb Center closes, it could mean they would have to quit their jobs to stay home to care for a special needs child. Parents learned Nov. 13 that the center would close at the end of the year because of state budget cuts. Kids at the center range from infants to age 10 and have developmental problems such as autism and mental retardation. The center has a staff of eight. The state Department of Disabilities and Special Needs cut funds for five child day-care programs, including the Webb Center. State Sen. Robert Ford, D-Charleston, said he is optimistic about restoring state funding to the Webb Center in the new budget year beginning July 1. \"We're almost sure that we're going to be able to do it,\" Ford said. The state money enables the center to receive matching Medicaid funds to meet its budget, officials said. On March 6, Ford, Gilliard and Senate President Pro Tem Glenn McConnell, R-Charleston, donated a total of $5,000 to the center. Ford said he has spoken with Sen. Finance Committee Chairman Hugh Leatherman, a Republican from Florence, who has been impressed with support for the center from local legislators. Ford said that House Speaker Bobby Harrell, R-Charleston, can pave the way for restoring center funding in the House. Ford said he thinks that the center also could be the beneficiary of federal stimulus money. Meanwhile, the Webb Center will be living from week-to-week on the largesse of the community. \"I can definitely go through next week. We're hoping for another two weeks,\" said Rick Magner, director of the Disabilities Board of Charleston County. The center's weekly operating cost is about $5,000, he said.",

Barbara Bergwerf, 65, commission member, and commission Chairman Ron Denton, 46, both have filed for the seat. Concerns about the community's short-term rentals and development prompted Bergwerf, a retired artist and photographer, to run. \"I feel like I could do more for the community on the City Council than the planning commission,\" she said. Bergwerf said no one, herself included, is against renting out island homes, but she is concerned with large six- to 10-bedroom homes being built within residential neighborhoods. \"I'm concerned about development on the island and the future development of the island,\" she said. Denton, an architect, said he is running to unify the community. \"I just want to bring cohesiveness between those who live in Wild Dunes, those who live outside Wild Dunes and a cohesive conclusion to concerns regarding short-term rentals,\" he said. The Planning Commission has been reviewing the city's current short-term rental ordinance to judge its effectiveness. Denton said some people in the community would like stricter laws, but he said the law needs examination before the city makes anymore changes. Denton said he would keep his eye on the city budget as a councilman. City officials have embarked on a number of projects, including building a new public safety building, he said. Cronin was elected to finish out the former mayor's term in February. His council seat is up for re-election in November.",

    "text": "Columbia will have to pay firm for hotel. A judge ruled Monday that Columbia taxpayers owe design firm Stevens & Wilkinson money for a publicly funded hotel the city never built. The Columbia-based design firm says the city owes it $1.6 million for work it completed on a publicly funded convention center hotel project from December 2003 to April 2004. Two weeks ago, city attorneys rejected a $1.6 million settlement offer from Stevens & Wilkinson, saying the two entities never had a contract. Monday, Circuit Court Judge Casey Manning ruled the city did have a contract with Stevens & Wilkinson but did not rule if or how much money the city had to pay. That question will be settled later, in front of either a jury or a judge. But it means city taxpayers likely will have to pay something at a time when the city is furloughing its employees and cutting $4 million in order to make its budget this year. It\u2019s unclear if the city will appeal the decision. Kathleen McDaniel, an attorney with Callison Tighe & Robinson, which represents the city, said Monday night she had not had time to review the order and declined to comment. \u201cThis ruling is a dramatic development on behalf of Stevens & Wilkinson,\u201d said attorney Dick Harpootlian, who represents the design firm. \u201cThey owe us something, the amount to be determined.\u201d Manning\u2019s order, known as a partial summary judgment, is rare for a plaintiff, the party who brings the lawsuit, said John Nichols, past president of the S.C. Trial Lawyers Association, now known as the S.C. Association for Justice. \u201cThe plaintiff always has the burden of proof and the burden of production to start a lawsuit off,\u201d Nichols said. It\u2019s more likely that a defendant would win summary judgment, he said. In issuing his order, Manning cited the deposition testimony of three people: interim city manager Steve Gantt, Councilwoman Tameika Isaac Devine and Charles Phillips, an expert hired by the city. Further testimony is expected before it is determined what the city owes. Devine, an attorney, is the only council member to give a deposition so far. Attorneys for the city have asked Manning to prevent other council members from testifying on the grounds of legislative privilege \u2014 the legal doctrine that prevents public officials from being asked to explain their votes. In 2003, the city decided it would build and operate a hotel across from the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center. City Council hired Stevens & Wilkinson, Turner Construction, Gary Realty and Garfield Traub Development to work on the project. All the parties signed a memorandum of understanding. However, in April 2004, after considerable public opposition to the project, City Council voted to give $4.5 million for a private developer \u2014 Bo Aughtry \u2014 to build the hotel, a Hilton, which opened in August 2007. In 2005, the four companies that had worked on the public hotel project sued the city, saying the city\u2019s memorandum of understanding was a contract, and by going with a privately developed hotel, the city broke that contract. The companies are asking for the money the city would have paid them had the public hotel project gone forward. Monday\u2019s ruling does not affect the status of the other companies; their portion of the lawsuit is still pending. \u201cThis is the first of what we hope will be a lot of dominoes to fall,\u201d said attorney Brink Hinson, who represents Gary Realty and Garfield Traub Development. Stevens & Wilkinson is asking for an additional $1.6 million for work it says it completed on the project from December 2003 to April 2004. In July 2003, after working three months on the project, Stevens & Wilkinson said they were stopping their work until the city could borrow the money to pay for the hotel. Stevens & Wilkinson offered to continue working on the hotel project for $650,000 through Oct. 15, 2003, and $75,000 a week after that. City Council members approved this deal, and on Dec. 13, 2003, paid Stevens & Wilkinson $697,084.79 \u2014 which lead Manning to write: \u201cThus the three tenants of contract have been established: offer, acceptance and valuable consideration.\u201d",

A man authorities say was shot by a state trooper after he tried to hit the trooper and a woman with a car last week in Swansea was jailed Tuesday. Gregory M. Crolley, 42, of Swansea, who suffered gunshot wounds to the head and hand, is at the Lexington County jail, charged with two counts of assault with intent to kill, SLED arrest affidavits say. Crolley was a passenger in a 2001 Chevrolet Cavalier that was stopped March 16 on suspicion of DUI on S.C. 6 near U.S. 321, authorities said. Crolley got into the driver\u2019s seat and tried several times to hit Trooper Drew Ledbetter and Crolley\u2019s wife, Amelia, who was being detained, authorities said. Ledbetter opened fire when the car came toward him about 10:30 p.m., SLED said. Amelia Crolley was charged with DUI, Department of Public Safety spokesman Sid Gaulden said. Gregory Crolley was taken to Palmetto Health Richland in stable condition for treatment of his gunshot wounds. Ledbetter, who had been placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of SLED\u2019s investigation, has returned to regular duty, Gaulden said. It is not the first time Gregory Crolley has been arrested. His convictions date to 1985, including assault and battery with intent to kill, assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, second-degree arson, criminal domestic violence and housebreaking, SLED records show.",

    "text": "Lexington County smoking ban push reignited. Supporters of a smoking ban for Lexington County settled Tuesday on a deal that is less than desired but is designed to end a stalemate. The plan would snuff smoking in restaurants and bars, except on outdoor decks and patios and inside private clubs that were open as of Jan. 1 this year. Restrictions in stores, offices and other places would remain at the owner\u2019s discretion. \u201cIt\u2019s the best we can get right now,\u201d council chairman Debbie Summers said. The plan quickly won approval from a County Council committee, setting the stage for ending a conflict that has persisted since fall. The nine-member council can take it up as soon as April 14. Some supporters say the proposal is the last attempt to break the standoff. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t make it, the deal is dead,\u201d Councilman Bill Banning said. But he expects narrow approval next month. Allowing smoking decks and patios is \u201ccreating miniature leper colonies,\u201d Councilman Todd Cullum said. All nearby communities with a ban allow that except for the town of Lexington. Mayor Randy Halfacre said he will seek to permit smoking decks and patios in his community if the new county plan for unincorporated areas is put into place. But town leaders will stick with their ban on smoking inside any workplace, he said. The new plan for county restrictions is \u201ca big step\u201d even though it is less than some advocates want, Halfacre said. The plan received a mixed reaction from one spokesman for the bar and restaurant industry. Bars and restaurants can live with a uniform ban, Tom Sponseller said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a level playing field, everyone gets treated the same, and there\u2019s no harm,\u201d he said. But he is concerned the exemption for private clubs could become either a loophole or a restriction so tight that it also bars smoking in country clubs and sites that nonprofit clubs operate for members.",

    "text": "Lexington 4 to raise taxes, cut staff. Lexington 4\u2019s proposed 2009-10 spending plan will include reductions in the overall budget and staff, the result of declining revenue and enrollment in the upcoming academic year. Superintendent Linda Hawkins outlined a $21.8 million spending plan Monday, a $1.2 million reduction over the current level \u2014 even with a property tax increase to make up for having less state aid. The proposed tax hike \u2014 the maximum allowed \u2014 amounts to an extra $57 yearly for the owner of a home valued at $100,000. The financial picture is \u201cthe worst I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Hawkins said. The spending plan submitted to the school board calls for a staff reduction of nearly 18 \u2014 14 teachers and four others, with some going to part time. The district now has 457 employees. More than half of the teachers eliminated are retirees who had come back to the classroom. The staff cuts reflect an expected enrollment decline of nearly 100 students, to 3,200, in the Gaston and Swansea area schools. \u201cWe are looking at every possible thing we could cut, working smarter,\u201d Hawkins said. Hawkins wants to avoid staff furloughs. \u201cThat is an option we don\u2019t want to do. If things get much worse, we may have to.\u201d The seven-member board is waiting until May to see whether revenue forecasts improve or worsen before acting on the plan. The cuts reflect \u201cdire times,\u201d board chairwoman Sheila Parkman said. \u201cYou\u2019ve made some good choices,\u201d Lawrence Livingston said of the plan.",

Families and young professionals have also discovered the city's first- rate services, outstanding park facilities and recreation programs, and big- city amenities while preserving a small- town feel. Spanning more than 20 square miles, Greer's city limits to the north offer outdoor recreation at Lake Robinson, Lake Cunningham, and Apalache Lake, while the city's southern boundary includes a major transportation corridor with Interstate 85 and the Greenville- Spartanburg International Airport. Downtown Greer, known locally as Greer Station, has become a destination in itself with approximately 12 square blocks of retail, dining, entertainment, and professional service organizations. Greer Station has more than 40 buildings on the National Historic Register. Greer Station took on a new look in 2008 as new municipal facilities opened to serve the public. A two- story Police and Court Complex anchors the west boundary of Greer Station, while the new three- story Greer City Hall and 12- acre City Park are just two blocks to the east. City Hall includes an entire floor dedicated to public space, with a 4,500- square- foot events hall available for conventions, receptions, and galas. Just steps from the events hall, City Park includes a large fountain timed to music, an amphitheater for public concerts and ceremonies, walking trails, a picnic shelter, a pond, and ample green space for family fun. The city's events staff keeps City Park the center of recreation in Greer, planning concerts and family festivals throughout the year. The 2009 Fourth of July Celebration at City Park July 4- 5 will offer a weekend of music and fireworks not to be missed. Highway 29 extends from Greenville to Spartanburg and passes just north of Greer's main business district. However, you will find nearly anything you may want on that stretch of highway in Greer. From fast food or fine dining to charming boutiques and chain department stores, it is a vibrant commercial corridor in the city. Home to the nation's only BMW manufacturing plant, which offers public tours departing from an informative visitor's center, Greer also has been home to the Michelin North America main headquarters for almost a quarter of a century.",

    "text": "West Columbia City Council calls special meeting . Mayor Bobby E. Horton called the Special Council Meeting of the West Columbia Council to order on Monday, March 16, 2009 at 6 pm. All members were present: Mayor Bobby E. Horton, Mayor Pro- Tem Tommy G. Parler, Eric L. Fowler, L. Dale Harley, Jack L. Harmon, Boyd J. Jones, Marsha J. Moore, Cathy Shannon and B.J. Unthank. John Banks, director of tourism with the West Metro Chamber of Commerce spoke on the various ways the chamber is promoting the area. Among other points, Banks said that special emphasis would be given to improving West Metro's brochures and encouraging business travelers to stay in West Columbia hotels. Additionally, Banks told council that the chamber was working to redesign its ads at the Columbia Metropolitan Airport. Banks said that a frequent complaint from visitors was that the ads at the airport were difficult to read. Banks added that the chamber would be promoting the West Columbia area's whitewater rafting opportunities. He reminded council that visitors can go whitewater rafting in the morning and see a play in Columbia that evening. Councilman Harley said he was particularly impressed with this idea. Banks also announced that the chamber was completely redesigning its website. Banks said that Splash Omnimedia of Lexington, South Carolina has been hired for the job. Mayor Horton said the city of West Columbia had received a grant from the state to assist in domestic violence evidence collection. The mayor reminded council members of their upcoming budget meetings. First reading unanimous approval was given to an ordinance that would move West Columbia city elections to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in odd- numbered years. Currently, the city holds elections on the first Tuesday in September on those years. Mayor Horton pointed out the reason for the ordinance was to align the city with other municipalities in Lexington County and to encourage voter turnout, as most voters are used to casting their ballots in November. Unanimous approval was given to a resolution authorizing the mayor to award contracts to the lowest responsive, responsible bidders to improve the city's water and sewer system contingent upon authorization by SRF Authority. Tom Bowlers with AECOM addressed council briefly on the matter and responding to a question from Councilman Fowler said the work on the city's water and sewer system would likely begin in about 30 to 45 days, once the credentials and qualifications of the subcontractors have been examined and additional documents had been received. Unanimous approval was given to a resolution authorizing the consumption of beer and wine in cups at the Riverwalk Music Festival and the Rhythm on the River Concert Series at the Riverwalk Amphitheatre. Mayor Horton strongly emphasized that beer and wine consumption would only be allowed at the Riverwalk Amphitheatre during those specific events.",

    "text": "Riverbanks welcomes three black- necked swan cygnets . The cygnets only spent about a day in the nest. By Saturday they ventured into the water with their parents in search of food. Unlike birds that nest in trees, the offspring of waterfowl are known as \"precocial\" species, which means they hatch with feathers, can see, and can feed themselves. The fluffy white chicks are currently on exhibit with their parents in the pond at Riverbanks' Bird Garden (opposite the Bird Conservation Center). Guests will most likely see them swimming around the exhibit or catching a ride on the back of one of their parents; you may have to look closely though, sometimes they tuck under their parents' wings for protection. This is the first set of offspring for the pair. The male, 9, came to Riverbanks in 2000 from the Santa Ana Zoo and the female, 5, came in 2004 from the Alexandria Zoo. Both animals are considered young parents, as swans can live into their 40s. The pair began nestbuilding in early January. The swans start by sitting on the ground and pulling organic material toward their bodies to build a nest up around them. The result is a conical- shaped shell. The birds then line it with feathers plucked from their own body to serve as insulation for the eggs when the parents are not on the nest. The cygnets, which are currently covered in down feathers, will begin growing juvenile feathers in two months.",

This exhibit will be featured in the Marly Berger Gallery through May 9. Working from memory, with only a pocketknife and the occasional handsaw, James Bunch has produced a body of work estimated at 300 pieces which range in subject matter from the familiar tools and mechanics which have been central to his life to elaborate pieces notable for their detail and kinetic features. \u201cHis human figures are perhaps most striking, consistently stylized as stiff but expressive individuals sharing hallmarks of character and community,\u201d said Robert Cogswell, director of folklife for the Tennessee Arts Commission.

    "text": "Weatherizing homes to create thousands of jobs - if stimulus works. \"We want them to go through Ohio as deeply and as widely as possible,\" said Phil Cole of the Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies. The state expects to receive $267 million to insulate, seal and otherwise improve home energy efficiency for thousands of low-income Ohioans over the next three years. Cole said the government spent less than that on weatherization programs for all 50 states last year. \"What we're being asked to do has never been done before,\" said Cole, who speaks for the anti-poverty organizations that will do most of the work. \"There's no pattern to follow.\" But there is an ideal path, which supporters describe in one-thing-leads-to-another terms: Agencies hire weatherization workers or contract with small businesses, creating jobs. They also buy trucks, insulation supplies, furnaces and water heaters, boosting the local economy. Residents' utility costs drop by an average of 30 percent, saving money and energy. Heating subsidies for the poor cost taxpayers less, and families spend the extra cash. \"This thing has so many opportunities for mischief and mismanagement,\" said Leslie Paige, spokeswoman for Citizens Against Government Waste, a taxpayer watchdog organization based in Washington, D.C. \"It's very vulnerable to fraud.\" She said the pot is too large and the ramp-up time too short for small community-action agencies to manage. \"You're taking a sleepy little program and you're going to ram $5 billion at it, and on top of that you're going to say it has to be spent as quickly as possible,\" Paige said. \"It's a recipe for disaster.\" Some also question whether the program really can put more than 87,000 Americans to work, as President Barack Obama asserts. No one expects it to be easy, said Bill Graves of the Ohio Department of Development. Ohio received about $30 million in federal money for weatherization in 2008, so the stimulus money represents an increase of almost 800 percent. \"What are my worries? I wouldn't say worries; I'd say optimistic concerns,\" he said. \"This is a lot of money. It's a monumental task.\" Pat Williams says she's ready. As manager of the weatherization program at Impact Community Action Agency in Columbus, she could soon oversee a threefold increase in production. On a sunny, warm-for-March day last week, Williams had three crews of three working on drafty city homes. \"I'll have three more crews in the next few weeks,\" she said. \"When the stimulus hits, I plan to go to 16 to 20. This is going to make a tremendous difference in people's lives.\" Williams also is excited about the agency's ability to offer jobs with health insurance. She wants to hire as many people as possible, but Impact Executive Director Bo Chilton said the community-action agency doesn't want to create more positions than it can maintain. \"We'd hate to take on 30 new staff and then lay them off in two years,\" he said. \"So we'll probably be using contractors, too.\" Whether to create jobs or hire businesses can be a thorny issue for community-action agencies, most of whose missions include employment training. \"They're both legitimate business models,\" said Dave Rinebolt, executive director of Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, an umbrella group for energy-assistance groups. \"We anticipate plenty of jobs either way.\" Sean Babylon is thrilled to have one. The 32-year-old recently moved back to Columbus from Arkansas and badly wanted to return to Impact, where he had worked in weatherization before. He was surprised to learn that the agency could add employees. \"It's a big weight off my shoulders,\" Babylon said. \"I wake up and think, 'Wow. I have a job now.'\" Home weatherization as a public program has its roots in New England during the energy crisis of the 1970s, said Rinebolt, who first worked in Minnesota. He watched support wither during the next two decades and eventually lost his job to budget cuts. The coming boom is an about-face like nothing he has ever seen. About 7,000 low-income Ohio homes usually are weatherized each year at a maximum per-unit cost of about $3,900. With the stimulus money, the program could reach 26,000 homes a year at up to $6,500 each.",

    "text": "Compromise required for transportation bill to pass. Ohio lawmakers voted almost completely in lockstep with their parties on a bill to provide billions of dollars for road projects, move forward with plans for passenger trains and toughen rules on drivers. Now they'll have to learn the art of the compromise. The House, controlled by Democrats, approved nearly all of Gov. Ted Strickland's two-year, $9.5 billion transportation budget, including controversial provisions green-lighting speed cameras in construction zones; a study of passenger rail service connecting Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati; stronger enforcement of seat-belt laws; and solar- and wind-energy projects on the right-of-way along the Ohio Turnpike. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, wiped out nearly all of those provisions, although the train idea held on by a thread. Democrats say cameras to nab speeders in construction zones and enforcement of the seat-belt law as a primary offense meaning drivers can be ticketed even if it's their only violation will enhance public safety. Republicans say the changes are about money and infringe on personal freedom. Democrats say the rail plan would provide a new transportation option for Ohioans and stimulate economic development. Many Republicans say the idea hasn't been adequately researched and may not find enough riders. Democrats say the state owns plenty of unused land along the turnpike that could generate green energy. Republicans say the idea was too ill-defined for them to approve. Those disputes, and dozens of smaller differences between the House and Senate bills, now go to a bipartisan, six-member conference committee to iron out the differences. The committee is tasked with developing a final bill that both chambers will either accept or reject. Though once used regularly, conference committees became a far rarer occurrence in the past decade-plus, as members of the Republican-controlled legislature grew to view the committees as a failure of compromise. But with a new Democratic-controlled House and GOP-run Senate for the first time in 16 years, the conference committee should see a resurgence. \"As a leader, you kind of want a bill to go conference committee because you have more control over it,\" said Sen. Jon Husted, a Kettering Republican who served four years as House speaker. The conference committee is scheduled to do its work today, Wednesday and Thursday if needed. It won't have time to dawdle: Strickland must sign the final compromise bill by March 31. The budget is for the 2010-11 fiscal years, which begin July 1, and the legislation doesn't take effect for 90 days. Conceivably, the conference committee could strip out the more controversial provisions such as the new driver rules and move forward on the rest of the bill. Scott Varner, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation, said it's been at least a quarter-century since the agency's budget wasn't approved by the March 31 deadline. Herb Asher, professor emeritus of political science at Ohio State University, said he doesn't expect partisan wrangling to doom the transportation budget this year. \"You can't have endless stalemate,\" he said. \"Transportation is very important to the state, very important to the economy.\" There could be horse-trading on some of the items; for example, Republicans could yield on the speed cameras in exchange for Democrats dumping the seat-belt provision. But Asher said it doesn't have to be that simple. \"Conference committees have a substantial amount of power,\" he said. \"You don't have to split the difference.\" Husted said it remains unknown how the new Statehouse political dynamics will play out. House Speaker Armond Budish, D-Beachwood, is new to the process and veteran Senate President Bill M. Harris, R-Ashland, has been out of Columbus for weeks with a badly broken leg. \"What does happen will foreshadow how problems are solved with the operating budget, which is a far bigger issue,\" Husted said of that $54.4 billion two-year spending plan, which will be decided in June.",

Va., on a parole violation and will be returned to Meigs County, Prosecutor Colleen Williams said in a news release. Williams, along with James Lee Garnes, 39, of Pomeroy in Meigs County, also has been charged with receiving stolen property and tampering with evidence. Garnes appeared in Meigs County Court Friday and is being held on $50,000 bond. Williams is accused of killing Doris Jackson, whose strangled body was found inside her home Feb. 26. Local police recovered her stolen 1989 Mercury Marquis in Athens two days later. Jackson, who lived alone, hoarded packages, clothing, boxes and other items, county Sheriff Robert Beegle said, and her body was found beneath a three-foot pile of belongings. The prosecutor said she may seek additional charges against Williams when she presents the case to grand jury.",

    "text": "County's tornado-siren dead zones still unresolved. The county operates 157 of them, but coverage remains spotty in the southeast and southwest corners. An additional 17 sirens are scheduled to be installed in Columbus, Pleasant Township, Madison Township and Grove City this year. No one knows exactly how many sirens the county needs, but one planning document allows for 200, said Michael R. Pannell, the county's director of emergency management and homeland security. Individual jurisdictions are responsible for buying the sirens, and the county handles their operation. Pleasant and Madison townships both used a three-year, no-interest loan program through the county to buy the $20,000 sirens. Dublin operates its own sirens and is fully covered with 24, said Michael Racey, a city spokesman. Wednesday's statewide drill is largely meant to prepare Ohioans for tornado season, which runs from April through July, according to the state's Emergency Management Agency. While the sirens go off, alerts will be broadcast on television and radio. State officials say they hope that schools, businesses and families will practice their disaster plans. That's part of the reason the drill is scheduled for 9:50 a.m., said Kelli Blackwell, a spokeswoman for the state agency. People will be at work and school, where they can practice. It also avoids conflicts with broadcasters who have news updates at the top of the hour. Franklin County typically tests its sirens at noon on Wednesdays. If people don't have disaster plans to practice, maybe Wednesday's drill and the state's Severe Weather Awareness Week, which ends Sunday, will have them thinking about one, Pannell said. \"Be aware about what you can do to be better prepared,\" he said.",

    "text": "State falls short of spending targets for minority businesses. A state law on the books since 1980 requires agencies to set aside 15 percent of purchases for bidding by minority-owned businesses only. But total spending with minority companies in fiscal year 2008 was 3 percent of $2.3 billion. Purchases from companies participating in the Encouraging Diversity, Growth and Equity program, or EDGE, totaled 2.1 percent last year - while the goal in the state's administrative code since 2004 is 5 percent. \"These numbers are staggering,\" said state Sen. Ray Miller, D-Columbus, a vocal advocate of compliance with minority-business participation goals. \"It's unacceptable.\" Gov. Ted Strickland required the scorecard for the first time as part of an executive order he issued last June that sought better participation in the state's Minority Business Enterprise and EDGE programs. The idea was that requiring an annual measurement would spur better compliance, and the governor ordered other steps such as requiring each state agency to appoint an officer to monitor compliance. The scorecard for the 2008 fiscal year, which ended June 30, showed that only one of 22 cabinet agencies met the 15 percent spending goal for minority-owned businesses. Of the 12 reporting state colleges and universities, two met the goal, while six of the 58 state boards and commissions were in compliance. \"The governor expects to see improvement in the future,\" spokeswoman Amanda Wurst said. \"This scorecard certainly will provide us a baseline for improvements.\" Ron Sylvester, a spokesman for the Department of Administrative Services, said the state is working with agencies to identify missed opportunities for using minority or disadvantaged vendors and to find new vendors if necessary. State law says that if no bid is submitted by a minority-owned business for contracts set aside for such companies, the purchase is made according to usual procedures. Miller argued that the state must aggressively market opportunities to minority and disadvantaged companies, streamline the certification process for them and encourage majority contractors to subcontract with them. \"We should see some change because I am certain the governor is going to give this the highest priority and strongly encourage his cabinet and all other agencies of state government to do much better than they have in the past,\" he said. Various statements have been made in previous administrations, both Democratic and Republican, about the need to increase contracts and state jobs for minorities. Paul Mifsud, the late chief of staff for former Gov. George V. Voinovich, even said in 1995 that the Cleveland Republican \"is a guy that lives and breathes equity\" and is committed to affirmative action \"every day of the year.\"",

Decatur city officials have scheduled two community meetings for later this month to talk about plans to ease overcrowding by reconfiguring school attendance zones. The meeting dates are March 17 and March 25. Both meetings start at 6:30 p.m. and are billed as dual \u201cinformational and listening\u201d sessions. The reconfiguration plans have caused a stir among parents since early indications that officials might move all fourth- and fifth-graders to the city\u2019s lone middle school. Fourth- and fifth-graders now attend classes in the standalone Glennwood Academy campus. If the plan proceeds, Glennwood would house only kindergarten through third grade. The move would help the system weather an expected increase in students, particularly in elementary grades. According to system officials, the number of students in kindergarten through eighth grade is expected to grow over the next four years from 1,897 to 2,388. However, parents have told school board members that they worry about having the younger students on the same campus as older students, and said the middle school campus itself would grow too big City schools Superintendent Phyllis Edwards expects to present a plan to the board in May.",

State Rep. Stephanie Stuckey Benfield has tried and failed, twice, before in an annexation bid for Avondale. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten the 10 signatures in the past,\u201d the Decatur Democrat said of the county delegation\u2019s rules for the needed number of sponsors for local legislation. \u201cBut it makes sense, and it\u2019s something that is important for that area.\u201d The latest proposal calls for the cities\u2019 borders to meet at Sams Crossing. Both cities have backed away from larger annexations, in part because of resident objections. This plan, though, involves mostly commercial lots, 10 in Decatur and 22 in Avondale. That means the property owners would not likely be city voters or, in Decatur\u2019s case, would not overburden local schools. \u201cThey\u2019re just going for the people who can\u2019t vote against it,\u201d said Charles Blalock, who opposes the annexation and owns three of the lots in Avondale\u2019s sights. \u201cDon\u2019t drag me into your town just to get more dollars,\u201d Blalock said. Leaders in both cities say their main goal is to square their borders and provide better police service in the area. For Avondale, trying to redevelop its downtown, it\u2019s also about having the power to force garages and small business in the proposed annex zone to clean up their appearance. \u201cIt\u2019s really a gateway into Avondale, and we\u2019d like to see some improvements in that corridor,\u201d said Avondale Mayor Ed Rieker.

She urged them not to surrender control of their lives, saying, \u201cI have never believed in living in somebody else\u2019s shadow. I made my own decisions. What outside people think, you need to keep on the outside.\u201d Clayton, founder of the Trumpet Awards Foundation, which honors accomplished African-Americans, praised Sunday\u2019s event. \u201cI hope these kids will learn and pass it on. As a society, we must help each other,\u201d she said. The high school seniors were transported to the event in a 30-foot Escalade limousine. After lunch, they were given an upscale goodie bag that included a BCBG dress, a set of fragrances, a devotion book, an overnight bag and a certificate of accomplishment. Oh \u2014 and a $1,000 scholarship. \u201cI was pretty shocked,\u201d said Kayla Swain, a Lovejoy senior who expects to attend Ohio State University in the fall. The money, advice and support are meant to reward talented young women but also to add to their momentum. For instance, Chidinma Anyiwo is a Mundy\u2019s Mill senior who is headed next year to the University of Georgia. Four years from now, she hopes to be ready for medical school. Four years ago, she was in Nigeria. \u201cMy uncle was here,\u201d she said, \u201cand he said if we came here, we would get more opportunity to become whatever we want to be.\u201d It's a Southern tradition like nowhere else.",

Johnson, 41, was arrested on charges of attempted robbery and aggravated battery, according to the news release. The victim of the robbery was not harmed, but the person who came to her aid received a minor injury to his hand, according to the news release. Bond was set at $20,000 Saturday morning for Johnson during an appearance in the DeKalb County Courthouse, according to staff at the DeKalb County Jail.

    "text": "Sycamore family serving as March for Babies am bas sadors. Annika Jones quickly drifts off to sleep Saturday. Nestled in her mother\u2019s arms, content from having just finished a bottle, she sighs softly as she naps. Kristina and Tim Jones, both 27, refer to 9-month-old Annika as their \u201clittle miracle.\u201d The couple lost their first child, Hailey, in May 2006 just 15 minutes after she was born during Kristina\u2019s 26th week of pregnancy. Two miscarriages followed before Annika was born June 13. \u201cI don\u2019t think, up until the day I went to the hospital, that I would go in and have a C-section and come home with a baby,\u201d Kristina said. The Jones family is this year\u2019s am bas sador family for the March for Babies in DeKalb County. A fundraiser for the March of Dimes, it will be held April 25 in Hopkins Park in DeKalb. The county\u2019s walk raised more than $54,000 last year, and Lisa Kijowski, chairwoman of the March for Babies of DeKalb County, would like to exceed that this year. The March of Dimes is a nonprofit that works to improve the health of babies through research and education. Its goals are to prevent birth defects, premature birth and infant mortality, according to the organization\u2019s Web site. An estimated half-million babies are born premature annually in the country, according to March of Dimes. The Jones family said the organization has provided support and information to them, and they lauded the group for the funding it provides for research and educational efforts. This is the third year they have taken part in the local walk. Team Hailey, which consists of about 30 friends and family members, has raised a combined $13,000 during those three years for the March of Dimes. They accepted the role of 2009 ambassador family for the local walk so they should share their story, Tim said. \u201cMore often, you hear the good stories, where the baby survived,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t as fortunate. But it\u2019s a story that people need to hear because it does happen.\u201d Kijowski said the ambassador family usually is \u201csomeone who has been truly touched\u201d and has a direct connection with the March of Dimes. \u201cI think people have a tendency to forget when there is not the sight of a physical family or babies there to share their story,\u201d Kijowski said. \u201cUsually, when the ambassador family has shared their story, there\u2019s not a dry eye in the house.\u201d The Joneses\u2019 story starts with Hailey, who was born with Ebstein\u2019s anomaly, a heart defect in which the tricuspid valve is abnormally formed. The tricuspid valve normally has three \u201cflaps,\u201d or leaflets, according to the American Heart Association. With Ebstein\u2019s anomaly, one or two flaps are stuck to the wall of the heart. Kristina had gone to the doctor because she hadn\u2019t felt Hailey move much; after an ultrasound, the doctor told the Joneses that the baby was in distress and needed to be born immediately through a Caesarean section. At 26 weeks, Hailey had a 40 percent chance of survival. Tim and Kristina said they were in shock at the news. When a pediatrician told them there would be some decisions to make after the birth, \u201cwe both knew what that meant,\u201d Kristina said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think we had time to think. It went really fast,\u201d Kristina recalled. \u201cShe lived 15 minutes. That\u2019s it.\u201d Tim and family members were told first; Tim told Kristina when she awoke after surgery. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we went through it,\u201d Kristina said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re here smiling. It\u2019s unnatural. Parents aren\u2019t supposed to see their child die.\u201d Doctors advised Kristina and Tim to wait a year before trying to have another child, which they said was hard but gave them time to grieve. Frequent visits with doctors and specialists led to Annika\u2019s birth last year. Hailey is never far from their minds, Kristina said, and being able to help other babies in her name is an honor. \u201cWe can raise this money for other babies, so when other babies are born at 26 weeks with a heart condition, one day, none of them dies,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s our passion. We don\u2019t want to see families go through what we went through.\u201d March for Babies For information about the March for Babies in DeKalb County, call Lisa Kijowski at 815-899-5743. Visit www.marchforbabies.org for more information. This year\u2019s walk starts at 10 a.m. April 25 at Hopkins Park in DeKalb. The March for Babies of DeKalb County is sponsored by Kishwaukee Community Hospital and Valley West Community Hospital, as well as The National Bank & Trust Co., Castle Bank and Soft Water City. A fundraiser will be held April 1 at Culver\u2019s, 1200 DeKalb Ave. in Sycamore. A portion of proceeds from that day will be donated to the March of Dimes.",

    "text": "Kishwaukee College hosts annual book sale. MALTA \u2013 About 5,000 books are stacked on, under and around tables near the entrance to the Kishwaukee College library, separated into subjects as diverse as those on the library shelves \u2013 job search, self-help, textbooks, encyclopedias and a small mountain of paperback fiction. \"We've been getting donations throughout the year and discarding throughout the year, and we had a book drive about a month ago,\" library staffer Mary Middleton said. \"A lot are related to the degrees and programs we have here at the college, and we got a lot of fiction donations.\" And those thousands of books are available for purchase this week during the library's annual book sale. Paperbacks in the sale are priced at 50 cents and hardcover books at $1. The proceeds from the sale will help the library to purchase new books and materials, Middleton said. When deciding which books to discard, the library staff consider the condition of the book and the number of titles on the shelf with the same subject, she said. They also consider the age of the information. While the information contained in art books never expires, she said, computer or political science texts can become obsolete. \"We try to keep the library updated with relevant information,\" Middleton said. Some of the most desirable books were snapped up early by used book dealers waiting outside the door when the library opened Monday, Middleton said. The books that don't sell by the time the event ends Saturday will either be set out on tables for students to take for free or will be sent to an online used book distributor for sale, she said. Though the annual book sale has been going on since 2004, it's not the only opportunity to get a deal on the library's used books, Middleton added. A section of shelves on the library's second floor is filled with books that are always on sale, she said. \"That sale goes on year round, so if someone misses the book sale, they might want to come check that out,\" she said. If You Go The Kishwaukee College library's annual book sale is being held through Saturday in the library on the college's campus at Route 38 and Malta Road in Malta. The library is open from 7:30 a.m.-9:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 7:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. Friday and 8:30 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Saturday.",

    "text": "Two vying for Kirkland president post. The two candidates running for Kirkland president have one thing in common: Both have held the office before. Incumbent Mike Becker is facing village trustee Les Bellah in the April 7 election for village president. Bellah was village president from 1996-2004. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed sitting at that part of the table and interfacing with people, with business owners, on the one-on-one basis,\u201d Bellah said Monday when asked why he wanted to run for village president again. \u201cThose people look for some guidance and leadership and I feel like I provide both.\u201d Becker has been president for the past four years and said he wants to continue doing a job he enjoys. He described himself as \u201ca little more cautious or conservative,\u201d traits he said are beneficial for an elected official to have. \u201cSometimes decisions are made in a quick manner or are looking for cheapest solution and that may or may not be the best solution,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to look into and understand each issue totally before developing a solution for it.\u201d If elected, Becker said he would focus on the city\u2019s economic survival. He would ensure the village \u201cmaintains community services within our limits during tough economic times.\u201d It will be tough, he said, because he doesn\u2019t expect the village\u2019s revenue to increase much in the near future. \u201cI\u2019m not not sure how we do that. We have to keep a very careful eye on what we spend and how we spend it, and make the most that we can with our money,\u201d he said. Bellah said he would focus on spending as well, but said he would provide \u201clittle or no compromise\u201d on keeping the police and public works departments well staffed because both are needed to ensure public safety. He advocated for expanding neighborhood watch programs to \u201clet the people be the eyes and the ears of the police department.\u201d And he said he would ask residents to support local businesses, noting many leave the village to shop elsewhere. Bellah said he would go door-to-door to talk to residents about that, or hold town meetings were shopkeepers could talk to residents about their struggles to stay afloat. A priority for Becker would be to examine options for the village\u2019s wastewater treatment plant. The existing plant is \u201cgetting near the end of its life term,\u201d he said, and the village needs to consider methods of replacing it. \u201cGiven these times, I\u2019m not sure we can do it,\u201d Becker said, adding he would recommend the village seek federal funding for assistance. At the very least, he said, they need to start planning for a new one. Another priority for Bellah is enforcement of traffic laws in the village. Many motorists traveling on Route 72 through the village exceed the speed limit, which is 35 miles per hour coming into and leaving town, and 30 in the village, he said. \u201cThe trucks speed through extremely fast, and people are running stop signs,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they think the word \u2018Stop\u2019 means.\u201d Both men said they would be a good fit for the job. \u201cKirkland is my home. I really care deeply about what goes on in the community,\u201d Becker said. \u201cIn the years I\u2019ve been on the village board, residents know they can come to me with a problem and I will try to get to the bottom of it,\u201d Bellah said.",

    "text": "NICE to tidy neighborhoods. DeKALB \u2013 Residents in the city\u2019s fourth ward might soon be getting a knock on their door and an invitation to clean up. A pilot program that aims to tidy DeKalb neighborhoods was unanimously approved by the DeKalb City Council Monday. The Neighborhood Improvement Coordination Effort, or NICE program, will kick off during NIU Cares Day \u2013 a day devoted to performing volunteer work in the community \u2013 which is April 18 this year. Northern Illinois University students volunteering that day would be enlisted to clean up participating properties along public alleys and streets in the area between Fourth and Seventh streets bounded by Culver and Charter streets. This area was chosen because it contains alleys that have long been neglected, Public Works Director Rick Monas said. Jamie Smirz, the city\u2019s special projects coordinator, said the goal is to get different programs to work together as one. \u201cWe have a lot of programs that the city already offers that we will be basically educating the neighborhood about,\u201d Smirz said. \u201cIt really is an extension of our rehab program.\u201d Rather than trying to combat property maintenance issues through strict code enforcement, NICE would encourage residents to take part in rehab programs, like the city\u2019s partnership with the DeKalb Lowe\u2019s store. Lowe\u2019s gives the city supplies for free or at discounted prices, which the city distributes to qualified applicants \u2013 usually low-income homeowners or people recommended by social service agencies, Acting City Planner Sue Guio said. Other programs use federal dollars from the Community Development Block Grant to rehab homes. It\u2019s the first time the city is trying to utilize these programs on an area-wide effort rather than on an individual basis, Guio said. \u201cIt\u2019s more of an interpersonal contact of making people aware of what the city can offer,\u201d 4th Ward Alderwoman Donna Gorski said. She and 3rd Ward Alderman Victor Wogen will begin door-knocking to recruit participants. The targeted neighborhood for the pilot program has about 200 residents, Gorski said.

    "text": "Body found in Kish River identified. A body found this weekend in the Kishwaukee River was identified Monday as that of a Wisconsin man last seen Christmas Day in DeKalb. The body of 56-year-old James C. Verduin was found about 2:45 p.m. Sunday in the river near Hopkins Park in DeKalb. Verduin was identified Monday during an autopsy, DeKalb County Coroner Dennis Miller said. Preliminary autopsy results show Verduin, a father of two from West Allis, Wis., drowned, Miller said. \u201cWe don\u2019t suspect any foul play,\u201d Miller said, adding there were no wounds, bruises or other marks on the body. \u201cThere was no sign of a struggle.\u201d Miller said Verduin probably died Christmas Day or Dec. 26, and has been in the river since then. A couple walking their dog Sunday afternoon in Hopkins Park noticed the body floating face up in the water behind the 200 block of Joanne Lane, according to police reports. Police do not know where Verduin entered the water. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with rivers, currents can certainly have a huge effect on where you\u2019re going to find an object,\u201d DeKalb Police Lt. Gary Spangler said. \u201cHe could have went into the river 100 yards of where we found him, he could have gone in by the hotel. We just don\u2019t know.\u201d Verduin\u2019s body might have been stuck on something in the river, Spangler and Miller said, which is why it hadn\u2019t been found until now. If that was the case, recent heavy rainfalls caused the river to swell and could have dislodged him, Spangler said. Authorities believe Verduin wandered into the river, Spangler said. \u201cWe are aware of some emotional issues that could have contributed to the death,\u201d he added. The body of Verduin, who was found wearing only boxer shorts, was discolored but intact, according to police reports. Verduin \u201cmore than likely discarded the clothing before or while in the water,\u201d Spangler said, but added that the clothing has not been found. Verduin was expected to attend a family gathering Dec. 27, but left a message for his family that he needed some time away by himself, his brother, Bill Verduin, told the Daily Chronicle in January. The family is not sure why he was in the DeKalb area on Christmas Day, when he was involved in a one-car accident on Interstate 88. Verduin declined treatment at the scene of the accident, according to police reports, but appeared a bit disoriented by people he came in contact with after the accident. Miller said Verduin showed no signs of head trauma. His family has said Verduin had diabetes. After his car crashed into a tollway truss, it was towed from the scene, and the tow truck driver dropped Verduin off at the Best Western DeKalb Inn & Suites, police said. Two days later, a hotel employee called Verduin\u2019s family and asked them to pick up his belongings, noting that he had never checked out. The family called police, who searched the area around the hotel that night, police said. Several additional air and ground searches were conducted in the days and weeks following his disappearance. Phone messages left Monday with Verduin\u2019s family members were not immediately returned.",

    "text": "Board appointments go forward aside from discussion. The appointment of residents volunteering to serve on Dublin's boards and commissions is usually a pretty uncomplicated procedure. However, a resolution for the appointments began a discussion among Dublin City Council members at their Monday, March 16 meeting regarding the appointment of a City Council member to the city's Planning and Zoning Commission. During the council's goal-setting retreat in February 2008, council members unanimously approved a motion to appoint a seventh citizen to a commission seat previously held by a council member, with plans to review the new process formally in January. Council members Michael Keenan, Rick Gerber and John Reiner, along with Mayor Marilee Chinnici-Zuercher and Vice Mayor Cathy Boring voted 'no' to Councilman Tim Lecklider's motion to not make the appointment to the planning and zoning commission until after discussion of the process, with Councilwoman Amy Salay joining Lecklider in voting 'yes.' \"We have had a tremendous workload,\" Chinnici-Zuercher said. \"When we made the decision to have this discussion in January, this decision was made before the resignation of our city manager, and our search for a new one. \"Boulder City Council offered then Dublin City Manager Jane Brautigam a position as its city manager Aug. 10, 2008. Her last day in the Dublin post was Sept. 26, 2008. The national search for a new city manager began Sept. 8, when City Council unanimously approved a motion to engage the services of Thomas Dority Sr., vice president of the Mercer Group, for the recruitment process. The result was the appointment of Terry Foegler as Dublin's city manager, and his first official day of work was Feb. 17. \"This discussion is important, but we have had to go to a second tier of consideration,\" Chinnici-Zuercher said, as she suggested council members discuss the commission issue in a committee of the whole meeting to be scheduled before September. \"It clearly needs to be discussed,\" Keenan said. Following City Council's disapproval of the motion to exclude the planning and zoning seat from the appointments, it unanimously approved the following appointments:* Chris Amorose Groomes and Flite Freimann, four-year terms on the Planning and Zoning Commission, expiring March 31, 2013. * Carl Karrer, three-year term on the Architectural Review Board as the Dublin Historical Society representative, and Robert Schisler, three-year term on the ARB as an Historic District merchant representative. Both terms expire March 31, 2012. * Victoria Newell and Brett Page, a three-year term for each on the Board of Zoning Appeals, expiring March 31, 2012. * Patrick Todoran, to the unexpired term of Keith Blosser on the Board of Zoning Appeals, a term which expires on March 31, 2010. * Christine Gawronski and Dona Givens, both reappointed to a three-year term on the Community Services Advisory Commission, expiring March 31, 2012. * Kevin Cooper, three-year term on the Community Services Advisory Commission, expiring on March 31, 2012. * Susan Burness, three-year term as the city representative to the Dublin Convention and Visitors Bureau Board, a term which expires on March 31, 2012. * Jamie Boff and David Cecutti, reappointed to three-year terms on the Parks and Recreation Advisory Commission, expiring March 31, 2012. * DeWayne Howard, three-year term on the Personnel Board of Review, a term which expires on March 31, 2012. \"I do not wish to vote 'no,' because of the balance of those folks who have been appointed,\" Lecklider said, as he cast his 'yes' vote. There is one remaining appointment to be made to the Architectural Review Board, and City Council hopes to complete this appointment at its April 6 meeting, Clerk of Council Anne Clarke said via e-mail Tuesday, March 17. Board and commission members will have an orientation and training session at 6:30 p.m. Monday, March 30 in Talla 2 at the Dublin Community Recreation Center, 5600 Post Road, Chinnici-Zuercher said.",

    "text": "Committee plans May benefit along with dedication. It may have seemed, at times, like it might never get there, but the Dublin Veterans Project is moving closer to its fundraising and dedication goal. \"We are 80 percent to our goal,\" project committee member Michael Kehoe said during Dublin City Council's regular session Monday, March 16. The committee has raised nearly $612,000 toward its goal of $790,000, he said, with eight of 25 trees designated in the sycamore grove section of the memorial. In 2006, Dublin City Council committed $250,000 to the project, with another $250,000 in funds to be raised by the Veterans Project fundraising committee. At the time, plans proposed to have the completed project's dedication on Veterans Day in 2007. But the project ran into obstacles when city staff learned in July 2007 that the total construction cost for the Grounds of Remembrance memorial was approaching, if not exceeding, $800,000. The cost overrun resulted in the Veterans Project committee unanimously approving a motion to allow project design firm Plant Architect Inc. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada a second chance to come back to the committee with a design for the Grounds of Remembrance project that would meet the original $500,000 budget. The project was designed to include an entry sign, a copper clad loggia, a memory wall, a dedication wall, walking path and associated site work, according to information from the city. City Council unanimously approved a resolution accepting a base bid of $478,840 from the McDaniel Construction Corp. as the lowest and best bid for the project in August 2008 and construction began shortly after. The project committee has a fundraiser, the Red, White and Blue Bash, scheduled for 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. May 1 at the Villas at Coffman Park, Kehoe said. Tickets are $300 each and include a dedication stone, he said. \"If they have already purchased a stone, we will offer another option,\" he said. The dedication of Grounds of Remembrance in Dublin Veterans Park is on track to take place Memorial Day, Monday, May 25, \"following the parade led by the VFW and American Legion,\" Kehoe said. \"You have all done an incredible job raising the funds and increasing awareness of this very important memorial,\" Dublin Mayor Marilee Chinnici-Zuercher said. In other council business, legislation was approved authorizing the city to enter into a pre-annexation agreement for 5,600 acres on the east side of Hyland-Croy Road at 8600 Hyland-Croy Road in Jerome Township, in order to obtain city water and sewer services. Legislation amending the annual appropriations ordinance for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2009, also was approved. In addition, council approved a resolution allowing the city to enter into an agreement allowing the operation of a Subway restaurant in the Dublin Community Recreation Center. The city previously had a lease agreement with TehKu Tea Co. TehKu ceased operations at the center in August 2008 due to its inability to prosper, according to information from the city. \"We learned a lot from that experience,\" Dublin Recreation Services Director Matt Earman said. Following a patron survey conducted by city staff, Subway was found to meet the primary criteria of providing prompt service for all menu options, a variety of healthy food options, and a business strategy with proven success inside a recreation center similar to the DCRC -- the Natatorium in Cuyahoga Falls, he said. The estimated timeframe for full operation at the DCRC is eight to 12 weeks, according to information from the city. The center's restaurant will include breakfast sandwiches as well as the full Subway menu. Council adjourned to a closed session for discussion of legal, land acquisition and personnel matters, according to information from the city, at the request of Dublin City Manager Terry Foegler.",

    "text": "Dublin students getting a kick out of Martial Arts classes. Students from several Dublin elementary schools don't have to rely on action television shows to get a dose of martial arts before school in the morning. Instead they come to school early to study with Master Greg Fears, a retired police officer and veteran competitor on the world martial arts stage. Fears teaches children and adults at the Ernie Reyes' World Martial Arts School in Carriage Place, but he said coming to the schools to work with students is a welcome addition. \"It's refreshing -- just to know that you can have an impact in their lives,\" he said. Fears' classes at Glacier Ridge, Deer Run and Thomas elementary schools emphasize more than kicks and punches. He also tries to reinforce what parents are teaching their kids, he said, including respect and life skills. \"When you hear it from more than one person, it ends up sinking in,\" he said. Glacier Ridge third-grader Adam Alkire said Fears taught his class \"that we're to help people and not start fights. \"Alkire just completed his third four-week session with Fears and earned his Little Dragon Red Belt. Allison Jennings is also a third-grader at Glacier Ridge. She said Fears taught her and her classmates that respect and concentration are important. Jennings put her concentration to good use to break a board into three pieces with her hand at the conclusion of the final class. \"I was, like, amazed,\" she said about the two breaks she made in the board. Each of the 18 students in the Glacier Ridge class took on -- and broke -- the board, with family members looking on and classmates watching in respectful silence. Fears said each student had to choose whether or not to try to break the board. \"You feel more confident that you've overcome that obstacle,\" he said. \"The point is not to see if you can break the board,\" he told students. \"The point is to empower yourself. \"Students kept the pieces of their broken boards, as well as their new colored belts. The martial arts clubs are open to elementary school students of all ages, said Heather Heinz, the Glacier Ridge PTO martial arts coordinator. Glacier Ridge offers the program twice per year. The club helps students by introducing them to the world of martial arts, providing a means of self-defense and developing self-confidence and character, Heinz said. It also offers physical benefits, including enhancing conditioning, flexibility, agility and coordination, she said. Fears said the Thomas club still had three weeks remaining in its current session, and then the clubs will be finished for the current school year.",

    "text": "Name gameCouncil is considering street name changes. Wichita Street or Wichita Drive? Dublin City Council heard a first reading on legislation to change the name of the street during its regular meeting Monday, March 16. Dublin Director of Engineering Paul Hammersmith said a discrepancy in what residents believe is the street name after it was brought to the attention of city staff by the Franklin County Auditor's Office. The city issued addresses for Wichita Street Dec. 16, 1986. Records indicate the majority of residents are using Wichita Drive instead of Wichita Street, according to information from the city. \"We think the developer installed street signs showing Wichita Drive, and that the posted sign is why the residents use 'Drive' instead of 'Street,' \" Hammersmith said. \"Folks moved in, started using Wichita Drive and that is where we are at today,\" he said. Hammersmith said letters were sent to the nine residents regarding the change, and that city staff has not heard back from them. \"The post office and 9-1-1 said everybody is using Wichita Drive,\" he said. \"It should be a simple change, which we will take care of at out next meeting,\" April 6, Mayor Marilee Chinnici-Zuercher said. Council also heard a first reading of legislation to change the name of a section of Darby Street in Historic Dublin to North Street. Darby Street currently originates on Bridge Street between the Dublin Veterinary Clinic, 32 W. Bridge St., and the BriHi site, and ends on High Street, south of the Dublin Branch of the Columbus Metropolitan Library, 75 N. High St.Proceeding north on Darby from Bridge Street, Darby Street makes a 90-degree turn to the east in front of the library, and causes confusion because the street intersects both Bridge and High Streets and runs both north-south and east-west, according to information from the city. \"We know this is actually called Darby Street, and that is part of the problem,\" Hammersmith said. Changing the name of the section running east-west in front of the library from Darby to North Street will also help meet one of the goals of the Historic Dublin wayfaring project -- to make visitors comfortable and confident while visiting the district, according to information from the city. Both the city and engineering departments support the change, there are no addresses to be renamed, and the library and the Blarney Brothers Ltd., adjoining property owners, have not expressed concerns regarding the proposed change. \"Some things do work in our favor,\" Hammersmith said. A second reading and vote on the legislation is expected during Council's regular meeting April 6.",

The spill is not considered major, but the EPD has a zero-tolerance policy for wastewater overflows that affect Lake Lanier's watershed. For more information, contact Horace Gee, Gainesville Environmental Services administrator, at 770-532-7462.",

    "text": "Former Hall County official named to Forsyth County post. The board voted 5-0 tonight to remove the \"interim\" tag from County Manager Doug Derrer's title. The decision was not unexpected. Two weeks ago, the board named Derrer as the sole finalist for the position. A 14-day period of review followed the announcement, in which the public could comment on Derrer's selection. Derrer is the fifth person to hold the spot since 2004. The position pays the same as his interim post, $130,000 per year, with a one-year severance should he leave. Derrer's job does not fall under the protection of the civil service board, a three-member panel that determines employee appeals. One added benefit to Derrer's contract as county manager is that the county will pay 100 percent of his health insurance. His government experience runs deep. A veteran of Hall County government, he retired in December 2007 after more than 25 years of service. He opted to take early retirement from Hall, but felt he \"still had a lot of energy left, and I feel like I still have a lot to offer the community.\" Months after retiring from Hall, he joined Forsyth as deputy county manager. He was elevated to the interim county manager spot after Rhonda Poston-O'Connor was fired as county manager in September 2008.",

    "text": "Gulf-war vet to bike from Norman to D.C.. He\u2019s a long way from home. His arms are aching and a warm shower would feel good. But Kevin George Baker can\u2019t complain. His mission is at stake. Sipping a Sprite during a stop at Gainesville\u2019s VFW Post No. 1922,, Baker, almost 40, talked about his plan to ride a bicycle from his hometown of Norman, Okla. to Washington D.C.Peddling a custom built hand crank bicycle, the disabled Gulf War veteran knew he would be among friends when he saw Gainesville VFW Post No. 1922 in the distance. \u201cI saw the VFW and I thought, \u201cThank God,\u201d Baker said. The purpose of his journey is simple. He\u2019d like to deliver an Honor and Remember flag to President Barack Obama. Honor and Remember is a nationwide project to bring recognition to American veterans. The organization\u2019s mission is, according to its Web site, \u201cto establish and promote a nationally recognized flag that would fly continuously as a visible reminder to all Americans of the lives lost in defense of our national freedoms. All Military lives lost not only in action but also in service, from our nation's inception.\u201d Baker doesn\u2019t have an invitation to visit the White House, but hopes the president will allow him inside, just for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m hoping President Obama will open the gates for me,\u201d Baker said, smiling. He\u2019s a likable guy who looks younger than he is. He\u2019s quick to talk about his progress and even quicker to listen to the words of others. He never gets tired of telling strangers why he\u2019s riding a bike to D.C.And strangers like to talk to him. Most have one main concern \u2014 Baker\u2019s safety. \u201cThey ask me if I\u2019m all right,\u201d he said. Baker is not easy to miss with his trio of flags -- an American flag, a Soldier\u2019s Angels flag and an Honor and Remember flag and his belongings strapped neatly to his bicycle and small bike trailer. It isn\u2019t easy to peddle the custom built bicycle, especially for a man with a disability. An enemy attack while serving in a naval firefighting unit in the first Gulf War left him with severe neurological damage. As a result, he can stand only with assistance. But using his shoulders, arms and hands he can peddle a bike like nobody\u2019s business. \u201cI may end up looking like the Incredible Hulk when I get back,\u201d Baker said, \u201cAll that upper body strength.\u201d He got the idea to start his journey during a tough time in his life. He was battling cancer -- a result, he said, of Gulf War syndrome, a set of troubling symptoms which include neurological disorders and several types of cancer. The U.S. Defense Department denies the existence of Gulf War syndrome but Baker is certain his time in Iraq, breathing the contaminated air from hundreds of Saddam Hussein\u2018s burning oil facilities, caused his cancer. The disease may even be the reason Baker chose to make the trip. \u201cIn December, I was going through chemo and I thought this might be the last time I can do something like this so I may as well try it,\u201d he said. He left his Norman home Saturday, March 7 according to www.honorandremember.org.His plan on Monday was to stop for a while in Gainesville before heading on to Sherman where he had decided to spend the night in a camp ground. Baker brought along the things he figured he would require during the 15-week trip -- about 150 pounds of gear including camping supplies. He tries to plan his stops so that he ends up at public campgrounds. Other times, he stays at hotels or motels. On a good day with calm winds and fair weather, he said he can do 50 miles a day. Some days, like Monday, are more difficult with relentless winds that make peddling a challenge. \u201cI was lucky to get 40 miles in today,\u201d he said. He\u2019s also met some kindred spirits on the trip. \u201cMy first day out, I peddled 48 miles and was through for the day. I stopped at a Shell gas station where I met a husband and wife. They were both veterans, and they ended up asking me to stay the night with them,\u201d he said. He admits the ride to Washington is one of the greatest challenges of his life. Baker said he isn\u2019t even sure he\u2019ll make it the entire 1,500 miles. \u201cI\u2019m not thoroughly sure I can do this, but I tell myself every day that I can and so far, I\u2019ve kept on going,\u201d he said. He isn\u2019t afraid he\u2019ll become too ill to continue the ride, he said. \u201cRiding this bicycle makes me feel stronger. I\u2019ve been sick for 11 years, but I\u2019m gonna be okay,\u201d he said. Baker said he isn\u2019t riding for his own recognition. He\u2019s riding for all the men and women who have fought and are still fighting in wars that most people don\u2019t spend too much time thinking about. And there\u2019s another, more basic reason for his ride. \u201cI love my country,\u201d he said. To follow Kevin George Baker\u2019s journey see www.honorandremember.org.",

    "text": "TxDOT puts FM 678 overpass on project list. It could take a few years, but residents of Cooke County are hopeful a new Texas Department of Transportation construction project will help make a dangerous Highway 82 intersection safer. TxDOT reportedly approved a request to fund an overpass running east and west over Farm to Market 678 on U.S. Highway 82, said Commissioner Gary Hollowell. Hollowell said the resolution is the combined efforts of a number of concerned citizens as well as members of the commissioners court. A group of commissioners wrote the resolution and presented it to TxDOT at least two years ago, Hollowell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve attended meetings at (TxDOT\u2019s district office) in Wichita Falls where we met with a nonbinding resolution committee. We provided TxDOT with a wish list of projects we would like to see completed. The list is prioritized, but TxDOT is not obligated to do it (the projects),\u201d he said. He said county judges and representatives of municipalities often appeal for projects they believe are important. The overpass at 678 was apparently a priority for many, Hollowell said, citing efforts by county commissioners, Cooke County residents and others including Callisburg Independent School District Superintendent Dr. Charles Holloway to get the project started. \u201cThe justification for the project are the accidents and near-accidents at this intersection,\u201d he said. The project is also the result of investigation and research by TxDOT officials. \u201cTxDOT spent time doing traffic studies and installing warning indicators (at the intersection),\u201d he said. \u201cThey also increased the number of turn lanes and added exceleration lanes and striping to try to highlight the area.\u201d The project is not scheduled to begin immediately. \u201cWe think it will be let in 2010 or 2012,\u201d Hollowell said. For many, the project cannot begin soon enough. \u201cThe sooner, the better,\u201d he said. The FM 678 and Highway 82 project is one of at least construction projected slated to take place in Cooke County. The 678 project is expected to be paid for by surety bond funds. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009 Stimulus bill) is reportedly funding two addition projects. These projects include a resurfacing of portions of Interstate Highway 35 from Highway 82 to the Red River and widening FM 2071 between FM 372 and FM 922.",

    "text": "Local business owners optimistic. On some mornings, the line at the Mom\u2019s Donut Shop drive-through window is four or five cars long, and the small building is filled with families and individuals gazing at the sweet treats through the glass display cases while employees pack the goodies into neat white boxes. Even in tough economic times people still like a treat now and then. Mom\u2019s Donut owner Cindy Davidson \u2014 who operates the donut business with her husband, Chris \u2014 said things haven\u2019t been all good, but they are not dismal. \u201cJanuary was real rough,\u201d Davidson said in a telephone interview Friday, \u201cJanuary is always a rough time for us because people are dieting and have spent a lot of money at Christmas, but things are picking up. This week which was spring break has been real good. We\u2019ve seen a lot of faces that we don\u2019t normally see.\u201d The Davidsons are part of a fairly large number of Gainesville business owners and operators who say they are not only surviving, they are thriving even in a bad economy. Some business owners choose to improve the look of their stores. Gainesville\u2019s Tom Thumb supermarket, which is owned by the California-based Safeway corporation, recently revamped its store on Grand Avenue. The changes are part of the company\u2019s plan to make shopping a bit easier for customers, said Connie Yates a spokesman for the company. The renovated Tom Thumb store was set up using the company\u2019s lifestyle concept, she noted. \u201cWe are in the process of remodeling all of our stores in Texas to have the lifestyles format,\u201d she said. The store is organized in more a customer-friendly way with lots of similar items grouped together. \u201cWe want to have one-stop shopping for our customers in an atmosphere that they can enjoy shopping in,\u201d she said. The store renovations are part of that plan. \u201cWe are very proud of our newly remodeled store in Gainesville and are doing everything we can using special sales and discount opportunities for our customers.\u201d Food is one requirement that cannot be ignored, she said. \u201cI have heard the grocery industry referred to as an essential industry. People have to eat,\u201d Yates said. A handful of Gainesville companies chose to settle in new locations. Curves, a local fitness facility, is set to move to a new office complex on Grand Avenue. Owner Judy Waskow said after some difficult times late last year, her company seems to be recovering quickly. \u201cThe end of the year was not good at all,\u201d Waskow admitted. \u201cBut January and February have started out well.\u201d She said although the move to the new building was essential \u2014 the building where Curves is located was sold over a year ago \u2014 the new location is a larger facility which she believes both current and future members will enjoy. Working out is a passion for many residents, she added. \u201cThere\u2019s a good bunch (of members) that work out regularly,\u201d she said. She also said the economic picture isn\u2019t perfect, but it isn\u2019t all bleak. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic,\u201d she said. Another Gainesville business set to move to new, larger digs is Landmark Bank. Landmark Bank Chief Executive Officer Basil Bigbie said the company has experienced \u201csteady growth in the north central Texas (Texoma) area. \u201d\u201cProviding our customers with access to new facilities along the Highway 82 corridor east into Gainesville and Lindsay was a natural progression for the bank,\u201d Bigbie said in an e-mail message. He also said the decision to open new facilities in this area came after a lot of thought and preparation. \u201cThe planning, strategy and allocation of resources for these two facilities was in place well before the recent economic events. We\u2019re excited to be moving forward with these two new banking centers and have already received a lot of positive feedback from the Gainesville and Lindsay communities,\u201d Bigbie noted. Local automobile dealerships faced a year when most major auto manufacturers reported huge losses. But a representative for one Gainesville-area dealership said business is not bad at all. Glenn Polk AutoPlex is posting sales and service numbers that are equal to 2007, which, a press release says, was a fantastic year. They attribute their success to repeat and referral business. \u201cAlthough lot traffic has slowed a bit, we still have a steady stream of our previous customers coming in, and referrals of their friends and relatives,\u201d said owner Glenn Polk. \u201cNot only are we proud of our hard work and the success that we have had in Cooke County, but we are proud to be a part of the American auto industry. We are excited to be a part of Ford Motor Company and Chrysler,\u201d Polk added. According to Polk\u2019s son, Trent, the company also employees approximately 60 people and has contributed almost $200,000 in donations, fundraisers and sponsorships. \u201cGlenn Polk AutoPlex averages between 125-150 new and used vehicle sales every month. Since opening in April of 1995, we have sold over 22,000 here in Gainesville. These kinds of numbers are equal to dealerships you\u2019d find in a big city,\u201d Trent Polk said. Like other business owners, the Polks said they encourage residents to shop local businesses. \u201cWe encourage folks to do business local. Keeping the money here in Gainesville is very important to the growth of our community,\u201d Trent Polk concluded. Auto dealer James Wood is another businessman who sees the potential in Gainesville. Wood recently made a deal to purchase Brown Motor Company. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking to put in a finance lot in Gainesville because it\u2019s such a good trade area,\u201d Wood said in a March 4 Register story. Wood said he believes the dealership will be larger than Brown Motor Company.",

    "text": "Flying Tiger bids Gainesville goodbye. Heading into the sky over Gainesville, the restored P-40 Curtiss Warhawk climbed and turned into the wind after 2-years of restoration to join the Commemorative Air Force (CAF) tours in Texas and Florida. Ray Kinney flew the Warhawk. Kinney, one of the owners of the Circuit Breaker Sales (CBS) Hanger at the airport, flew in to pick up the plane. After meeting with friends who helped to restore the World War II (WW II) aircraft, the pilot checked out the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk. Kinney donned his leather flying helmet, taxied up the runway and then flew over the airport several times before tipping the aircraft wings several times in salute, and roaring off toward his destinaiton. CBS was one of the main sponsors for the renovation of the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk, the plane made famous in WW II. Kinney said \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with aviation all my life. On Jan. 19, 1967, right after I graduated from North Texas, I went straight to the airport and bought some aviation lessons. \u201d\u201cI was in the Navy flying aircraft after submarines in early Vietnam,\u201d said Kinney. \u201cFor me, this is just about as good as it gets, flying the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk.\u201d said KinneyThe U.S. Air Force Fact sheet on the craft says the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk served in numerous combat areas during the war, including the Southwest Pacific, the Aleutian Islands, the Far East, the Middle East, Italy and some went to Russia. Though other aircraft often outperformed them in speed, maneuverability and rate of climb, the P-40 earned a reputation in battle for extreme ruggedness. According to historians, before the U.S. entered WW II, many U.S. volunteer pilots flew for China, Canada, Britian and the Soviet Union. A group of them \u2014 reads the web site www.flyingtigersavg.com \u2014 helped China as the country struggled against Japan and the American Volunteer Group of the Chinese army became known as the Flying Tigers and flew under the command of Gen. Clair Channault. Their P-40s were painted with the Chinese stars on the tops and bottoms of each wing, to identify the plane as a war ally and not an enemy plane. When the Warhawk left the CBS hanger, it was a replication of the Texan Flying Tiger Tex Hill\u2019s plane. His name and war battle scorecard are painted on the left side of the plane. The Flying Tiger logo and the \u201cFlying Panda\u2019s (one group of the Flying Tigers) are also painted on the plane as well as the Chinese stars . \u201cI had a long, wonderful history with Tex Hill,\u201d said Kinney. \u201cHe was as sharp a man as you could ever meet, even well into his 90\u2019s.\u201d Kinney said that he has a real connection with these WW II pilots. \u201cThe men who flew them were the age of my father,\u201d said Kinney. \u201cI met a lot of them personally.\u201d Aircraft and Engine Mechanic Larry Lange was the primary mechanic and had the responsibility of overseeing the whole restoration of the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk at the CBS Hangar. Machinists Norb Mages of Lindsay and Dennis Lopez of Thackerville, Okla. came to see the plane off. Both worked on the airplane and oversaw projects that involved retrofitting and overhauling. \u201cThis has been a great experience,\u201d said Mages. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this off and on for two years. \u201d\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate to be a part of it,\u201d said Lopez. \u201cThere are a lot of things that go through the machine shop but this takes the cake.\u201d Lange said that Mark Zello, owner of \u201cFlying Colors,\u201d was responsible for painting the plane, including the famous shark teeth. Retired pilot Mike Cavanagh came by to see the Warhawk off. \u201cI think every pilot is proud of Ray Kinney, the P-40 Curtiss Warhawk, and the work that Larry did,\u201d said Cavanagh. \u201cI would just come in and enviously watch it,\u201d said Cavanagh. \u201cI just watched it being put together, like a painting.\u201d To learn more about the CAF, how to become involved with WWII aircraft, or to find the groups touring schedule, go to www.commemorativeairforce.org.",

    "text": "Dog-nappers hit Lindsay area. Jerry Hughes bought his dog in Caddo, Okla. and he called him Okie. Now Hughes \u2014a 72-year old Cooke County resident \u2014 is having a hard time understanding why a brazen group stopped and picked up the eight month old dog. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they just drove up to my yard and took my dog,\u201d Hughes said. This isn\u2019t the first time Hughes and his wife have lost pets. He said a few years ago he had two other dogs. One of them was a cherished pet named Heck who he found on his doorstep one Christmas Day. \u201cMe and my wife were sitting in the house and we heard this whimpering noise and I wondered what in the world it was. We went outside and there was little dog in a box. Hughes said he joked with his wife about getting rid of the tiny puppy. \u201cBut I would never do anything like that,\u201d he said. Hughes said he and his wife fed the foundling with a bottle. \u201cHe was just a baby,\u201d he said. Heck grew up and Hughes said he developed a bond with his dog. \u201cHe was special. He was really special,\u201d he said. The other dog was a sweet Jack Russell terrier. But Heck was special. Heck had a habit of stopping by while Hughes was sitting in a chair in his living room. One day the dog walked up to his owner and lingered by the chair. The dog seemed uneasy or scared. At first, Hughes said he didn\u2019t realize anything was wrong. \u201cI thought he wanted me to pet him,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I petted his chest. He always liked me to pet him like this, \u201c he said, reaching out with his arm. Heck suddenly slumped at his feet. \u201cHe died in my arms,\u201d Hughes recalled, his eyes full of sorrow. Outside, he found the couple\u2019s Jack Russell stretched out on the ground, also dead. \u201cHe was stiff, you know. He\u2019d been there a while,\u201d Hughes said. He believes both dogs were poisoned. The latest incident finds Hughes grieving all over again. He said the crime was hard to comprehend. Two cars drove past his house and Okie - who was a friendly dog \u2014 just jumped into one of the cars. \u201cAll they had to do was whistle and he got right in the car,\u201d he said. He said he didn\u2019t get a good look at the car\u2019s occupants and still cannot describe them. \u201cI just watched them take my dog. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing,\u201d he said. His first concern was that the thieves might hurt Okie. \u201cThen I realized they weren\u2019t going to do anything to him. They took him because they wanted him,\u201d he said. Hughes also said he knows there isn\u2019t much anyone can do. \u201cI called the Lindsay Police and I talked to a (Cooke County) deputy that came out, but I don\u2019t think they can do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI just had to tell somebody.\u201d",

    "text": "Rodeo Gainesville looking for queen, princess candidates. Area girls from Cooke, Grayson and Love counties will get the chance to be the first ever queen and princess for Rodeo Gainesville. The Gainesville Riding Club will host Rodeo Gainesville during May 7-9 at the Gainesville Riding Club Arena. Known as rodeo royalty, the queen and princess candidates will be judged on two separate divisions: tickets sales and a riding pattern. Sixty percent of the girls overall score will be based upon their ticket sales, said Whitney Lemons, rodeo queen/princess coordinator. The other 40 percent, will be scored from a riding pattern the girls will be given before the rodeo. \u201cThe riding pattern has not yet been released,\u201d said Lemons. \u201cWe won\u2019t release that until two weeks before hand, maybe even a week until the rodeo in order to give them a little bit of time to get familiar with it and to practice. At the same time, we don\u2019t want to give the girls enough time to practice it everyday because we want to know how they work under pressure and on the spot.\u201d Queen candidates must be between the ages of 14-18 and princess candidates must be between the ages of 10-13, added Lemons. All candidates must have their own horse, have never been married or have any children and must have permission to compete from a legal guardian. Prizes for the crowned queen and princess will include a trophy saddle and other prizes to be donated by local merchants such as a belt buckle and sash. The girls will have six weeks to sell tickets, said Lemons. Ticket sales will begin Monday, March 28. However the deadline to apply for queen or princess has been extended through Friday, April 3. Interested girls can receive an application for queen or princess at Landmark Bank in Gainesville, 1110 E California Street; American Bank in Whitesboro, 851 Highway 377 N; or by contacting Lemons at (940) 736-8059. As part of the application process, Lemons said the girls will have to complete a short questionnaire to give the judges an idea of each candidate\u2019s personality. The winning queen and princess will get to ride nightly in the Rodeo Gainesville as part of the grand entry, said Lemons. Not only will they be featured nightly, but a special crowning will take place during Friday night\u2019s performance. The girls will also get the chance to ride and participate throughout the year as Rodeo Gainesville\u2019s queen and princess at other rodeos and parades of their choice. While the competition should be taken seriously, said Lemons, the main goal for the queen and princess competition is to give area cowgirls a moment to shine and to have fun. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty easy going,\u201d said Lemons. \u201cWe want to make it something that anybody can participate in. You don\u2019t have to be in the horse industry as far as showing or having real high-end horses. We just want it to be something that someone who has a horse for every day riding can compete in and to give all the young cowgirls in the counties a chance to compete.\u201d Lemons, who was the Gainesville Chamber of Commerce Rodeo Queen in 2001, described her experience as rodeo royalty as a great honor. \u201cIt is a great thing to be involved in and a great honor to hold,\u201d said Lemons. \u201cThe best advice I can give to girls competing, I would have to say, is to just work your ticket sales and know your riding pattern. You just really got to work for it but it\u2019s worth it.\u201d",

    "text": "No one injured in Newberry home invasion. A shot fired into the floor during a home invasion robbery in Newberry on Friday night may have been accidental, according to Alachua County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies. The incident began at 11:05 p.m. in a home in the 25400 block of SW 2nd Ave. The homeowner said he was inside his home a minute or so when four men forced their way into the home. Deputies said a woman who was a friend of the homeowner was also in the house at the time. The man and the woman told deputies that four masked men, including one carrying a gun, forced them to lie on the kitchen floor. The man said that when the intruders demanded money, he told them he did not have a safe or cash in his home. Instead, the masked men took cash and credit cards from the man\u2019s pockets along with his cell phone. \u201cApparently he was not lying still enough and the suspect with the gun fired a round that went through the kitchen floor,\u201d said sheriff\u2019s spokesman Art Forgey. After the gun went off, the intruders talked among themselves, saying that a shooting was not a part of the plan and asking the shooter why he had fired the weapon. \u201cThat makes us believe it may have been accidental,\u201d Forgey said. \u201cAnd they picked up the man and the woman from the kitchen floor to make sure they were not hurt before they made them get back down onto the floor.\u201d Before the men left the home, they also grabbed jewelry and a laptop computer from the bedroom of the homeowners\u2019 daughter, who was not at home at the time of the incident. Witnesses told deputies they saw a white, police-type sedan in the area shortly before the home invasion. The victims told deputies that the four men were similar in appearance \u0096 all were black men, about 5-9 to 5-10 with thin builds and about 20 years old. All four were wearing ski masks and were dressed in dark clothing, including baggy jeans and jackets. Anyone with information about the home invasion is asked to contact the Sheriff\u2019s Office at 955-1818.",

Off-duty officers from three agencies were called in early Saturday to break up a Chiefland bar brawl that turned into a street fight involving as many as 200 people. Chiefland Police Chief Robert Douglas said his officers were called to Knucklehead\u2019s Bar at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday to break up a fight that had moved to the parking lot. The first officers on the scene called for backup immediately due to the size of the brawl and then waited for additional officers from the police department, the Levy County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Florida Highway Patrol and all off-duty officers in the area to arrive. \u201cEven with all that manpower, it took about 30 minutes to remove the crowd and break up all the fights,\u201d Douglas said. He characterized the participants as mostly men in the 20s and 30s, with most from the Chiefland or Cross City areas. A motive for the fighting had not been established by Monday morning. \u201cWe have had some fights at that bar, but none this big,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sure what started this, but when we got there the majority of the fighting was in the parking lot where there were guys swinging bar stools. Some officers were hit in the head. It was a street fight.\u201d One man was arrested, although others could have been charged for a variety of offenses, officials said. \u201cAs the fights were broken up, people ran off and that is something we will be addressing for future events,\u201d Douglas said.",

The stabbing victim was taken to the hospital while the man accused of knifing him went to jail. The incident happened at about 4:30 a.m. Saturday in the Hardeetown area of Chiefland. Police Chief Robert Douglas said Stephen Davis, of Chiefland, had been arguing with Michael Durr, of Trenton. \u201cWitnesses told our officers that Davis tried to walk away, but Durr continued taunting him, and it got physical when Durr hit him (Davis) with a closed fist,\u201d Douglas said. Witnesses said Durr pulled out a knife with a black handle and a four- to five-inch-long blade that he used to stab Davis four times. Davis was taken to a Gainesville hospital for treatment of a punctured lung and other injuries. Durr fled from the scene and reportedly headed to a house outside Chiefland where he had been living with his girlfriend and their baby, parking the BMW he had been driving in the garage. Levy County sheriff's Deputy Mark Morgan was dispatched to the home Saturday morning because a fire had been reported there. Sheriff\u2019s spokesman Capt. Evan Sullivan said the State Fire Marshal's Office sent investigators to the scene because local firefighters believed the fire was suspicious. Durr was arrested a short time later and charged with aggravated battery.",

Tony Servance Jr., 20, the boyfriend of the Markel Barton\u2019s mother, pleaded no contest to second-degree murder for Markel\u2019s death in November 2007. According to court records, Servance was alone with Markel when the baby stopped breathing. Servance reportedly gave police at least two versions of what happened to Markel. An autopsy showed there was blunt-force trauma to the baby\u2019s head, which caused the internal bleeding that resulted in death. Acting Circuit Judge Mary Day Coker sentenced Servance to 15 years in prison to be followed by 24 months of probation and also ordered him to attend anger management classes. Markel\u2019s mother chose not to make a statement during sentencing.",

At 8:57 a.m., an employee at Cedar River Seafood and Oyster Bar, 5847 S.W. 75th St., said he was waiting for someone to come and repair restaurant equipment when he heard a knock at the back door, Alachua County Sheriff\u2019s Offices spokesman Art Forgey said. Forgey said when the employee opened the door, he was met by a man with a gun. The man forced the two employees in the restaurant to open the safe. After taking an undetermined amount of money, the man then attempted to tie the employees up with speaker wire. The employee told officials when the man couldn\u2019t get the speaker wire to hold, he individually plastic wrapped their hands together, Forgey said. He walked out the back door and headed west behind the Publix in the shopping center where the restaurant is located. The man has not yet been caught and is described as a black man between the ages of 35 and 40 years old with a medium\u2013sized build.

Toting signs that said \u201cVote no on 1\u201d and \u201cEquality for all,\u201d about 55 Gainesville residents marched Friday near the intersection of Northwest Eighth Avenue and Northwest 34th Street. The protesters opposed Charter Amendment 1, which would remove Gainesville\u2019s existing discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity, said Shelbi Day, a marcher and the director of communications and media for Equality is Gainesville\u2019s Business, which opposes the amendment. The march, which went along Northwest 8th Avenue for about 15 minutes followed by a sign\u0096holding demonstration at the intersection, included Gainesville parents, children, church members, faculty and students. Day said the march aimed to let locals know that Gainesville says \u201cno\u201d to discrimination. On the other hand, Micanopy resident Troy Blakely, who held a sign in favor of the amendment near the Supervisor of Elections Office during early voting on Saturday, said the amendment should be passed because it represents a public safety issue and would protect against sexual predators. Art Ellingsen, a Gainesville resident and a member of the pro\u0096amendment group Citizens for Good Public Policy, referenced the group\u2019s commercial depicting a man entering a women\u2019s restroom. He said he worries about the safety of his baby granddaughter when she visits him if the amendment does not pass. Tamara Cohen, the director of multicultural and diversity affairs at UF and a member of the march, said she cares about issues of sexual violence and that is not what her fight against the amendment is about. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting Gainesville as an inclusive, welcoming city,\u201d she said. Zoe Falcone, a transgender UF botany senior and a march participant, planned to go to graduate school at UF but will leave if the amendment is passed. \u201cIt would be just bad for our reputation and bad for our city and bad for the university,\u201d Falcone said. After spending about 30 minutes at the Northwest Eighth Avenue and Northwest 34th Street intersection, about 15 demonstrators drove to the corner of Northwest 13th Street and Northwest 16th Avenue to continue holding their signs and listening for the occasional horn honks from passing cars.",

The citywide election will take place on Tuesday and voters may cast ballots at their precinct polling places between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Her office received many calls during the week from students asking if voters had to vote on all ballot issues and candidates, or if they could just choose one, she said. \u201cYou can vote for just one, or as many issues or candidates as you want,\u201d she said. Carpenter believed invigoration from the presidential elections last fall may also have played a role in student participation. \u201cI would like to think that some of our younger voters came to realize how important it is to participate in democracy,\u201d she said.",

Although most people appreciate the St. Marys for its serenity and unspoiled beauty, beer drinkers have found another use for the river \u2014 as a dumping ground for their empties. Dean Woehrle, co-chairman of the St. Marys River Management Committee, estimates about 60 percent of the trash picked up each year during the St. Marys River Celebration is discarded beer bottles. Considering volunteers have pulled more than 500,000 pounds of trash from the river and its tributaries since the first cleanup in 1997, that\u2019s a lot of empties. Woehrle believes the ratio of empties to other trash will remain the same when as many as 850 volunteers from Camden and Charlton counties in Georgia and Nassau and Baker counties in Florida participate in today\u2019s cleanup. Of course, beer bottles aren\u2019t the only trash pulled from the river each year. Past cleanups have turned up items such as couches, air conditioners, bowling balls, vehicle parts and refrigerators, stoves and other large appliances. Charlton County manager Steve Nance said he doesn\u2019t understand why people dump household furnishings in the river, because the county picks up those items at no extra charge on trash collection days.",

    "text": "State legislator sponsors bill for his industry. A state House leader is sponsoring a bill this session that would make it easier for his industry to sell houses. State Rep. Jay Roberts (R-Ocilla), chairman of the House Majority Caucus, is pushing HB 516, which would prohibit Georgia communities from putting restrictions on modular homes, which are built off-site at a factory. Roberts is a manager at Georgia Modular Systems, of Fitzgerald, a maker of manufactured homes, duplexes and townhouses. The lawmaker said he doesn\u2019t consider working on the issue a conflict of interest. \u201cI don\u2019t own a plant, but I do work in a plant,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, but nobody understands this issue. Nobody understands this business.\u201d He said his company does not sell many houses in Georgia. On his financial disclosure form, Roberts lists himself as an employee of Georgia Modular Systems. In an interview Friday, Roberts would not specify his position at the company, only saying he worked \u201cin management.\u201d He previously was a vice president at another modular-home business. Only a few Georgia cities, including Gainesville and Duluth, have zoning rules that restrict modular homes, but the issue has come up across the United States. Roberts\u2019 legislation stems from a legal battle that arose in 2005, when Gainesville officials stopped a local modular-home builder from finishing several homes in the city. Grant Smerecznsky, owner of Building Systems Network LLC, sued, and the issue is pending in the courts. He approached Roberts and Steve Snyder, executive director of the Modular Building Systems Association in Harrisburg, Pa. Smerecznsky said he has never used Roberts\u2019 company as a supplier, but he would if he had the chance. He said he does not think Roberts is serving his own interests with the bill. He said Roberts is simply standing up for an industry that he believes is being discriminated against by some communities because they think modular means mobile homes. \u201cHe\u2019s doing what an elected official should do,\u201d Smerecznsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing something for the people.\u201d Gainesville Mayor Myrtle Figueras would not comment, citing the court case. Councilman Danny Dunagan also said he could not comment on the case, but said of the bill, \u201cI have a real problem with a legislator pushing legislation that directly affects his business. I think that\u2019s kind of unethical.\u201d Rick Thompson, executive secretary of the Georgia State Ethics Commission, said nothing in the state Ethics-in-Government act prohibits a lawmaker from submitting legislation related to his own business. Snyder said he called Roberts to talk to him about the issue. Asked in an interview who lobbied for the issue, Snyder said, \u201cI did.\u201d Thompson said lobbyists for an industry \u201care required to register and report if they undertake to promote or oppose legislation.\u201d Told about this later, Synder said he initially misspoke. He said he talked with Roberts and provided him copies of similar legislation in other states, but he did not come to Georgia and lobby. Snyder is not registered to lobby in Georgia. Snyder said he was thinking of flying down for debate on the bill last week, but he decided not to because, \u201cI thought this whole thing was taken care of.\u201d Asked about Roberts pushing a bill affecting his business, Snyder said, \u201cI get that, but there is nothing diabolical here. I need a legislator who understands our industry. He said he\u2019d be happy to do it.\u201d Synder said Roberts \u201creally did a great job for us. I would hate to see this guy get mud on him.\u201d Roberts\u2019 bill has passed out of the House and is now under consideration in the Senate. Just before it passed, however, opponents of the bill submitted an amendment that weakens its authority over local zoning. The change, Snyder said, \u201cmakes the bill worthless to us.\u201d Roberts said he is now trying to change it back in the Senate. Al Outland, spokesman for the Georgia Municipal Association, said the group was concerned the bill would overrule local zoning, but the amendment allayed their concerns. If the amendment stands, the organization is neutral on the bill, he said. Roberts isn\u2019t the only lawmaker to introduce legislation this session about his own industry. Rep. Clay Cox (R-Lilburn) filed legislation to limit oversight of the private probation business. He is CEO of a large private probation company. After The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about the bill, Cox pulled it and said he is reworking it.",

    "text": "New Gainesville prison clashes with revitalization. A new detention facility planned for the heart of its Midtown district has some Gainesville officials wringing their hands. The city, in talks with Hall County and Corrections Corporation of America, wants to insure that the new prison, which will house up to 502 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, meets its idea of urban revitalization. The city began a project 10 years ago to clean up the rundown area and invested $250,000 in a study to map out a revitalization strategy, said City Councilman Danny Dunagan. Nashville-based CCA signed a five-year agreement to lease the old county jail from Hall County to operate the center on Main Street. The 20-year lease, with two 5-year renewals, will pay Hall County $2 million annually. \u201cThe last thing we want in downtown for 20 years is a prison,\u201d Dunagan said. The city has invested a lot in its Midtown revitalization, including a new police/fire station. Plans also call for a 13-story hotel and two nine-story office buildings. The city had even worked out a verbal agreement with the county to buy the old jail, Dunagan said. The plan called for the city to then lease the facility back to the county so it could sub-lease it to CCA, he said. But that deal would have run for eight years, Dunagan said, then the city would have the option of shutting it down. Councilman George Wangemann said the city is behind the economic boost the prison could bring to the city, but he wants it to fit in with the aesthetics. Louise Grant, CCA marketing and communications director, said that while the company is in the business of operating prisons, it is working to resolve the aesthetics issue with the city. \u201cSafety and security is our first and foremost priority,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re making a $4 million investment to upgrade the facility.\u201d Grant said razor wire is common at all its 60 facilities, but alternative fencing is being discussed. Since last week\u2019s announcement of the prison opening, CCA has received some 500 applications for the approximately 120 jobs available, Grant said.

    "text": "More rain on the way Tuesday night. A day after the state\u2019s climatologist declared the drought officially over in most of north Georgia, the first of two more rain-making weather systems pushed toward metro Atlanta early Tuesday. The National Weather Service said a frontal system will likely produce an inch of rain across north Georgia late Tuesday into Wednesday, with as much as 3 to 4 inches of rain possible across central and southern parts of the state. The rain should taper off Wednesday night, with another cold front arriving late Thursday, forecasters said. That system \u201calso seems to be a good precipitiation producer, with another 1 to 2 inches expected,\u201d the Weather Service said. On Monday, state climatologist David Stooksbury said that an usually wet March \u201chas brought major drought relief to North Georgia. Except for the Lake Lanier and Lake Hartwell basins, \u201cthe remainder of north Georgia is drought-free,\u201d Stooksbury said. The Weather Service has recorded 7.12 inches of rain so far this month at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, a surplus of 1.89 inches. For the year, the city\u2019s official rain gauge has tallied 13.70 inches of rain, only 1.24 inches below normal. The forecast for metro Atlanta calls for mostly cloudy skies, with a 40 percent chance of showers and highs in the low 60s Tuesday afternoon. The chance of rain jumps to 100 percent overnight, before falling back to 30 percent on Wednesday. Lows Tuesday night will be in the low 50s, followed by highs Wednesday in the upper 60s. Thursday will begin mostly sunny, with a 40 percent chance of shower and thunderstorms during the afternoon, when highs will be in the mid-70s, the Weather Service said. A 90 percent chance of rain is predicted for Thursday night, along with lows around 50 degrees. Partly sunny skies, highs in the upper 60s and a 20 percent chance of showers are forecast for Friday. The first part of the weekend should be nice, with mostly sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-70s on Saturday, followed by a 40 percent chance of rain on Sunday.",

    "text": "Statewide 211 could reach more poor. Regional 2-1-1, a dialing code linking needy Georgia residents with everything from food pantries to social services, could begin expanding statewide by the end of the year, United Way officials said. If approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission, the expansion would stretch the service to 69 currently unserved counties. Those include several rural counties, among the hardest-hit by foreclosure and unemployment in the state. \u201cYou want folks to be able to have access to information that helps them address basic needs \u2014 and you want them to be able to access that information wherever they live in the state,\u201d said Milton J. Little Jr., president of United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta, which initiated the exchange in 1997 and is leading efforts to expand statewide. United Way officials hope to submit a proposal to the commission by the end of the year. Right now, 2-1-1 callers are connected with operators at one of 11 call centers serving metropolitan regions across the state. Callers explain their needs to operators \u2014 anything from shelter after a weather catastrophe to rental assistance \u2014 who refer them to area service agencies. Organizers say the idea is to help people navigate the complex and ever-growing network of programs. It helps the needy in the most heavily populated areas of Georgia. But United Way officials have lacked the funds to expand to farther-flung areas, Little said. For them, \u201cresources as critical as emergency financial help to as general as where do I find a place to send my aging parents \u2014 they just don\u2019t have access,\u201d Little said. Expansion plans coincide with an increase in calls to the line. Operators fielded more than 370,000 calls in 2008, up from more than 336,000 in 2007. Little said some calls this time last year were for post-tornado help in the region. \u201cA lot of those callers now are bringing up issues related to food, clothing and shelter,\u201d said Little, who recently estimated 41.5 percent of Atlanta-area calls are for help with day-to-day expenses. Other states have been pushing to expand the program which United Way estimates connects 234 million people with social services. There are 29 states with full coverage, according to Linda Daily, director for 2-1-1 at United Way of America. They include Texas, where state funds cover 80 percent of the program\u2019s budget, she said. But many states are grappling with heavy shortfalls, and Daily acknowledged funding 2-1-1 could be a challenge. \u201cThe budget is the main hurdle,\u201d she said, adding national United Way officials have lobbied Congress for help nationalizing the 2-1-1 program. Pending federal legislation could set aside $150 million in state 2-1-1 grant money for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, and $100 million for each of fiscal years 2012 through 2015. Versions of the bill are in committee in both the House and Senate. In Georgia, a coalition of United Way agencies led by the Atlanta agency will draft a plan that outlines how to fund the expansion, including possible use of state money. It will have to be approved by the commission and later, state lawmakers.",

    "text": "Opposition Activists Held on Arms Charges. Ten persons, most of them affiliated with former parliamentary speaker Nino Burjanadze\u2019s party, have been arrested on charges of illegal purchase of firearms, the Georgian Interior Ministry said on March 23. Earlier on the same day Democratic Movement\u2013United Georgia (DMUG) party said nine of its activists were arrested in Batumi and Tbilisi, accusing the authorities of launching \u201ccampaign of terror\u201d against its activists. The Interior Ministry said it was not claiming \u201ca political conspiracy\u201d behind the arms purchase. \u201cThe Interior Ministry, along with other preventive measures, is constantly monitoring illegal turnover of arms,\u201d the Interior Ministry said in a statement. \u201cRecently several groups have been identified, which were showing interest in purchasing automatic firearms. Several members of these groups were arrested this morning. The Interior Ministry was not planning to make any statement until the end of the investigation, but some political and public organizations have responded to the incident and the issue was seriously politicized. The representatives of some political parties made tough statements. Hence, the Interior Ministry is providing to the society a part of evidence proving criminal activities of the detainees. Other evidences and information will be unveiled later.\u201d The evidence involves six separate episodes of covertly recorded footage of what seems to be a sting operation by undercover agents acting as arms dealers. In the fist footage a man identified as Giorgi Bolashvili, an activist from DMUG youth wing, negotiates with undercover agent terms for purchase of CZ-75 semi-automatic pistol for USD 400 and expresses desire to buy AKS-U submachine gun \u2013 a shortened version of Kalashnikov assault rifle. In the second footage a man identified as Bolashvili\u2019s cousin with the same first and second name \u2013 Giorgi Bolashvili meets the same undercover agent to buy the firearm. In the third episode a man identified as Vakhtang Narsia, an activist from DMUG youth wing, holding apparently UZI submachine gun, is discussing with another man \u2013 supposedly also an undercover agent \u2013 mobilization of supporters. In the fourth footage, Mamuka Shengelia, a driver of Badri Bitsadze, husband of Nino Burjanadze, is seen discussing specifications and price of various firearms with a person \u2013 apparently also an undercover agent. In the fifth and sixth footage a person identified as Giorgi Tsertsvadze is seen \u2013 his name was not listed among the DMUG\u2019s arrested activists released earlier by the party itself. Tsertsvadze, according to the Interior Ministry, was acting under the instructions of Shengelia to purchase the firearms. The sixth footage, also recorded covertly in what seems to be an apartment room, Tsertsvadze is checking various types of firearms massed in a corner of the room. Shota Utiashvili, head of the Interior Ministry\u2019s analytical department, has strongly denied any politics behind the arrest of these persons and also said that the investigation was not claiming there was \u201ca political conspiracy.\u201d \u201cWhat we know is that there are people who have showed interest in buying weapons and have bought weapons and they are arrested,\u201d Utiashvili said. Nino Burjanadze, the leader of DMUG, said after the Interior Ministry\u2019s statement that she was ready to cooperate with the investigation. She, however, said the evidence put forth by the investigation was not enough and needed further scrutiny. \u201cNot a single normal court will consider the evidences shown on TV as enough evidence to prove the charges that have been made,\u201d she told journalists. \u201cWe are familiar with such \u2018video evidence\u2019 and how they are made up. The footage needs very serious expertise. Probably the Interior Ministry will make this expertise. We will also try to make this expertise through our independent sources: when the footage was recorded, in what context, when and how the footage was edited and so on.\u201d \u201cWe are not rejecting to cooperate with the investigation,\u201d Burjanadze said and also added that the footage provided by the Interior Ministry would fail to confirm the allegations that her party was planning \u201carmed rebellion and was setting up armed groups for this purpose.\u201d Earlier this month the Georgian tabloid Alia reported that Bitsadze had a plan to set up armed groups. In an unusual move, the Rustavi 2 TV, picked up the newspaper article and covered the allegations extensively in its primetime news program on March 10. Meanwhile, it also emerged on March 23, that an activist from the Movement for Salvation of Georgia was arrested and charged with plotting a coup. The Movement for Salvation of Georgia was set up late last year and has not been an active player in the Georgian politics. Shota Utiashvili of the Interior Ministry told Civil. Ge that this arrest was not related with the case of illegal arms purchase. He said the Interior Ministry would unveil more details on the matter later. Some opposition politicians have expressed doubts about the credibility of the evidence put forth by the Interior Ministry. Zviad Dzidziguri of the Conservative Party, which along with DMUG and some other parties is planning to launch protest rallies from April 9 to demand President Saakashvili\u2019s resignation, said: \u201cIt was entirely a political stage show in which some fooled persons are taking part.\u201d Eka Beselia from Movement for United Georgia Party \u2013 also from the same group of parties planning April rallies, said: \u201cThere is no confidence towards such evidence put forth by the Interior Ministry.\u201d A group of opposition parties signed a joint statement condemning the arrest.",

    "text": "Ten Sent to Pre-Trial Custody. The Tbilisi City Court ruled on March 25 to send ten men, most of them with arms charges and others on coup plotting, to a two-month pretrial custody pending investigation. The eighth person, Giorgi Tsertsvadze, although not listed among DMUG\u2019s party activists arrested on March 23, was also held on the same charges of illegal arms purchase and according to the investigation was acting under the instructions of Mamuka Shengelia. Initial list of arrested persons disseminated by DMUG through the Public Defender\u2019s Office on March 23, hours after their arrest, also includes two activists - Nugzar Gogrichidze and Vakhtang Tushmalashvili. However, no word has been said by the investigation so far about these two persons. Although these two groups of suspects are formally being investigated in separate cases, both of these cases are politically considered in the same context of planned April 9 protest rally, as according to the investigation, some of the suspects were discussing possibility of provoking disorders during the planned rally. At the same time the Interior Ministry said it was not claiming political conspiracy behind these cases or that any high-profile opposition leader was behind the alleged plot. The Interior Ministry, however, also says that the investigation is yet \u201con its very early stage.\u201d Meanwhile, some opposition politicians say that evidence put forth by the investigation are not convincing and suggest that the series of arrests aim at scaring off the public from the planned protest rallies with revoking possible scenarios similar to the one that developed in Georgia in early 1990s, when armed coup was followed by years of chaos. Ten are from two separate groups with one having links to the Burjanadze\u2019s party.",

    "text": "Okruashvili: Saakashvili Greater Threat than Russia. Irakli Okruashvili, former defense minister, said Georgia was in a situation wherein removal of President Saakashvili from power \u201cis justified with any humanely method,\u201d as he posed \u201cgreater threat\u201d to the country than Russia. Okruashvili, whose party Movement for United Georgia is part of group of another dozen of opposition parties planning to launch street protest rallies from April 9 to demand the President\u2019s resignation, said in a televised interview that he personally had no presidential ambitions. The interview, which was recorded in Paris on March 24, was aired by late on March 27 by the Tbilisi-based Maestro TV, which covers mainly the capital city. Okruashvili, who has received political asylum in France, was sentenced to 11-year prison term in Georgia in absentia last year. \u201cAfter [the August] war politicians should give up manipulating with the issue of restoration of the territorial integrity, especially during the election campaign, because that is an issue, which will be impossible to resolve in next ten or fifteen years in the best case, if not in the next twenty or twenty five years,\u201d he said. Okruashvili said that after the August \u201cmilitary adventure\u201d Saakashvili had \u201cno legitimate right to stay in power.\u201d \u201cI know that the remarks, which I will say now will trigger lots of sharp comments, but I have to say it anyway \u2013 this is the case when removal of Saakashvili from power is justifiable with any humanely method. He is today the number one threat for the country and the greater threat than Russia,\u201d Okruashvili said. He said he did not believe that Russia was interested in removal of Georgia\u2019s current leadership and said such rhetoric was part of the authorities\u2019 \u201cpropaganda.\u201d \u201cA weak figure [in the Georgian leadership] like Saakashvili is more acceptable for Russia,\u201d Okruashvili said. \u201cSaakashvili, who has almost no western support and no one in the west is even saying hello to him, is more acceptable for Russia. New leader in Georgia means new hope\u2026 One thing is clear: Saakashvili is a headache for both the Georgian people and for the international community.\u201d \u201cIf in 2003 [the Rose Revolution] was called the democratic revolution, than today too the same right exists to repeat it; is there enough resources or not for that purpose, that\u2019s another issue,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt is up to the Georgian people, it is our duty to maximally painlessly remove Saakashvili from power. How that will be achieved? No one has the answer on that today\u2026 A right vision, a joint action plan on where we are moving is required here, instead of changing plans every day. If there is a clear vision and joint plan [by the opposition] it will be achieved.\u201d \u201cRemoval of Saakashvili will be a painful process and it won\u2019t be able to achieve in a day; it won\u2019t happen on April 9,\u201d he said. Okruashvili said that unity of the opposition was the only \u201cmedicine that will help to removal Saakashvili.\u201d \u201cWe [the opposition leaders] should forget all the personal regrets and mutual confrontation that we might had in the past,\u201d he said and added his party\u2019s relation with the one of former parliamentary chairperson Nino Burjanadze\u2019s was a good example of that. He said that in 2007 when he was arrested, Burjanadze, who was the parliamentary chairperson at that time welcomed his arrested and \u201cmade a speech in the Parliament which amounted to accusing me in the state treason; but today I have no problem in relations with Burjanadze, because we will fail to achieve our joint goal without forgetting personal regrets of the past.\u201d",
