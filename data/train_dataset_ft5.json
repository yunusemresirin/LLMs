In an online vote, 2,630 undergraduates cast ballots in favor of the $60-per-semester fee, and 1,182 opposed it. The school said Saturday that about 28 percent of the eligible student population voted. Public universities must get an OK from the Ohio Board of Regents before they can raise fees, and a show of student support is a requirement for that approval. Collection of the new student fee wouldn't begin until the $36 million arena is finished in late 2011.

  "text": "DNR tickets out-of-state boaters avoiding Ind. tax. HAMMOND, Ind. (AP) \u0097 The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is cracking down on out-of-state boaters who do not pay Indiana excise taxes. More than 300 people with boats moored in Hammond and East Chicago have been fined for failing to pay the tax. As many as 89 people could face fines of $500 and have their driver's licenses suspended for not acting on the tickets. Out-of-state residents can register their boats in their home state, but must pay Indiana excise taxes if they boat in Indiana. The recent crackdown was prompted in part by complaints by angry Indiana residents who pay the state's excise tax when they register their boats. ``These people felt they were being cheated,'' said DNR Lt. Jerry Shepherd. At the large Hammond Marina, about 85 percent of boaters live outside of Indiana. Port Authority Director Milan Kruszynski said ticketed boaters weren't happy, especially since they have to travel to Lowell Town Court if they want to contest the ticket. Of the more than 300 boaters cited in Hammond and East Chicago, between 150 and 200 refused to comply, contested or did not respond to the notice, said DNR Public Information Officer Shawn Brown. The Indiana General Assembly passed a law in 2006 to allow greater enforcement of the state's excise tax. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources launched a public education campaign to convince out-of-state boaters that Indiana is serious about collecting the tax.",

  "text": "Suburban sprawl encroaches on rural Ohio townships. MAINEVILLE, Ohio (AP) \u0097 Some rural townships in Ohio are imposing impact fees and other regulations on new residential development to keep suburban sprawl from encroaching on farmland. Officials in Warren County's Hamilton Township outside Cincinnati say the population spurt there is putting pressure on safety services and roadways. To cope with growth costs, the township imposed an impact fee on new development that led to a bitter and unresolved court challenge from home builders. Government officials also have changed a zoning code to limit the density of homes in rural areas. From 2002 to 2007, the number of farms in Warren County fell 14 percent from 1,036 to 896, one of the sharpest declines in the state.",

If you have the requisite bread and milk, feel free to turn your attention to locating a sled, some gloves and a hillside covered in snow. Sound simple? Well, it's Richmond and sledding options are a bit limited. There's a few hills, but it's hard to find a friend (or make a friend) with a decent decline in their backyard. In Henrico County, if a park is open you can use it for sled riding, just don't trespass on someone else's property, says a representative for Henrico County Police. Sledding is also permitted in Chesterfield County parks as long as park rules are followed, says Officer Morton with Chesterfield County Police. The biggest challenge may not be finding a park in Chesterfield County, but finding a hillside worthy of a sled. The winter storm has not been a long overdue play date for everyone. Travel is hazardous during a winter storm so take your time, slow down and keep plenty of distance between your vehicle and the one ahead of you. This is also a great time to practice driving without talking on the phone or sending text messages. You know who you are.",

  "text": "Monument For Sale. There are 12 houses for sale on Monument Avenue. That\u2019s up almost 60% from last year. This could be your chance to snap up a Monument mansion for a cool million (or two). Houses range from the low end at $620,000 up to two million and change. The biggest house clocks in at 7,526 square feet at 2031 Monument Ave. with five kitchens, six living rooms, ten office spaces plus five bedrooms. Its asking price is $899,000. The brick mansion designed by architect William Lawrence Bottomley who designed several houses in the Virginia area as well as New York is for sale at 2714 Monument Ave for $2,195,000. It features formal living and dining rooms, a powder room, an octagonal library and a gourmet kitchen. Marianne Donohue, a real estate agent with Long & Foster, says there\u2019s no real reason for the increase. The market varies from year to year. She does say that house prices are down in the Richmond area and that there is more inventory on the market than in the past. \u201cBut it\u2019s a great time to buy a house,\u201c Donohue says. \u201cThe rates are great. And there\u2019s an $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers with no interest. \u201c",

  "text": "Man arrested for DUI crash into parked car. A Richmond man was charged early Sunday morning with driving under the influence and three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment after Richmond police say he struck a car stopped along Interstate 75 with a flat tire. Evan P. King, 24, of Campbell Branch Road, was weaving back and forth while driving northbound on I-75 near mile marker 89 around 2 a.m. Sunday, Richmond Police Department spokesman Sgt. Willard Reardon said in a news release. King then struck a car containing a family of three which was stopped on the side of the road with a flat tire, Reardon said. The father was attempting to change the tire while the mother and an infant in a car seat were inside the vehicle, Reardon said. The mother suffered head and leg injuries and was transported to Pattie A. Clay Regional Medical Center, Reardon said. The severity of her injuries is unknown. The infant and the father were uninjured in the crash, which slowed traffic along the interstate for 30 to 45 minutes. King was lodged in the Madison County Detention Center following the accident. He is free on a $5,000 cash bond, jail officials said Monday. City tools takenA thief stole more than $2,600 in tools from the City of Richmond\u2019s public works department Friday. Employees at the department\u2019s E. Walnut Street offices discovered Friday morning that someone had used an office window to break into the building and made off with a number of tools, Reardon said. Missing are three Stihl chainsaws, three bull floats, five bull float handles, a Milwaukee brand hammer drill, a power post-hole digger, an auger and a handheld Stihl concrete saw, all valued at $2,681. The thief also damaged a Pepsi vending machine while attempting to break into it, Reardon said. Other crimes Two leaf blowers were reported stolen Friday by the owner of Silver Cliff Landscaping. The backpack-style Stihl blowers were taken from a truck being used at St. Andrews Retirement Community and were valued at $1,000. More than $2,500 in electronics were reported stolen Monday morning from an apartment in the 100 block of O\u2019Roark Avenue. The residents told police someone had cut the screen from the storm door and manipulated the lock during the early morning hours to break into the home. Missing were a Sony PlayStation 3, an XBox 360, games for both systems, 60 to 70 DVDs and two Dell Inspiron laptop computers. The items were valued at $2,550. A Louisiana man was arrested for carrying a concealed deadly weapon Sunday following a traffic stop near the Eastern Bypass. Sean Clouthier, 22, of Sulpher, La., was stopped at the intersection of Lancaster Avenue and the Eastern Bypass for a traffic stop, and a search of his vehicle uncovered a loaded 9mm pistol and a loaded .45-caliber pistol in the vehicle\u2019s console. A wallet was reported stolen Saturday from an unlocked car parked outside the Pink Flamingo Laundromat on Big Hill Avenue. The wallet was later recovered near Advance Auto Parts, but $108 in cash had been taken. Gabriel Shearer, 34, of Richmond, was arrested Saturday for misdemeanor theft by unlawful taking after Walmart employees detained him for allegedly taking $33 in merchandise from the store. Anyone with information about these crimes is asked to call the Richmond Police Department at 623-1162 or 623-8911. Brian Smith may be reached at bsmith@richmondregister.com or at 624-6694.",

  "text": "Police determine details of three-vehicle crash. Law enforcement could not say for sure Friday night how a three-vehicle injury accident on KY 52 occurred, but Sgt. Sam Manley from the Madison County Sheriff\u2019s Department confirmed Monday the sequence of events that sent all five people involved to the hospital with injuries. A 2005 black Ford truck being driven by Joseph Welch of Richmond was about to turn right (westbound) onto KY 52 heading toward Richmond, Manley said. A 1993 brown Cadillac driven by Larry Dunaway of Berea was traveling westbound and struck the pickup truck in the left rear, the deputy said. That then caused the truck to do a 180-degree spin, and it was left facing east in a westbound lane, Manley said. By that time, Manley said the Cadallic was facing west in the eastbound lane resulting in a head-on collision between an eastbound 1996 Chevrolet driven by David Arvin of Irvine. Arvin, Dunaway and his passenger, Barton Jones of Waco, were treated at the University of Kentucky Medical Center and were in \u201ccritical but stable\u201d condition, according to a UK spokesperson who gave the statement Saturday afternoon. Welch and his passenger Vickie Nguyen were taken to Pattie A. Clay Medical Center where they were treated for minor injuries.",

  "text": "Woman is robbed behind Berea apartment complex. Berea police are searching for a suspect in a March 21 robbery, but have only a limited description to go on. Berea Police Department spokesman Capt. Ken Clark said the victim in the robbery outside an apartment complex in the 800 block of Candlewood Drive could provide only a partial description. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much to go on,\u201d Clark said. The woman described the man who shoved her to the ground and stole her purse as a tall, large male wearing a dark or gray hooded sweatshirt, Clark said. The man fled the scene as a passenger in a green car. Clark said the woman was outside smoking behind the complex when the suspect pushed her to the ground, causing cuts to her knees and hands. \u201cThat\u2019s why we made it a robbery first (degree), because the statute says if someone\u2019s injured,\u201d Clark said. Walmart robberyA Berea man was charged with second-degree robbery and resisting arrest after fighting with Walmart employees and Berea police attempting to detain him for allegedly shoplifting from the store. Grant W. Graham, 27, of the 1000 block of Brooklyn Boulevard, was stopped by Walmart employees around 7 p.m. Sunday for allegedly attempting to take merchandise from the store. Clark said Graham was involved in an altercation with loss prevention specialists before fleeing, and then fought with officers who attempted to arrest him. Anyone with information about these crimes is asked to call the Berea Police Department at 986-8456. Brian Smith may be reached at bsmith@richmondregister.com or at 624-6694.",

  "text": "Rubbish mounts as recycling plan fails. Teething problems to the council\u2019s new waste collection services saw thousands of borough residents left with recycling piling up outside their homes. Filled recycling boxes in streets across the borough remained untouched as the council\u2019s new recycling contractor\u2019s SITA were nowhere to be seen last week. Since the two-week old service came into effect Hounslow Labour councillors revealed they have been repeatedly contacted by unhappy residents. Complaints have included the non-collection of recycling, non-delivery and loss of containers and emptied containers strewn across garden paths and pavements. Brentford ward councillor Ruth Cadbury said: \u201cThe numbers of complaints have rocketed and this means that people will be put off recycling. \u201cThis is terrible news for the environment, and will cost our council tax payers money as more waste goes to land-fill.\u201d At the time the council said it believed the system, which saw new containers for paper, plastic and food waste being dropped off at homes in the borough, would make it easier for residents to recycle more of their household waste. Hounslow\u2019s lead member for environment and planning, Councillor Barbara Reid, apologised this week for the failures of the service and said that she was taking the problem very seriously. She said: \u201dI want to say sorry for those residents that have been inconvenienced and give them my assurance that we are on the case. \u201cIt\u2019s so important as recycling really is a top priority for us. There has been a huge response for from the public and that\u2019s not a problem. That\u2019s exactly what we want and we will respond to their enthusiasm. We are taking this very seriously.\u201d Coun Reid said the problems had arisen after SITA had under estimated the waste and the logistics of the collection. An extra team have been commissioned to help with collections while extra staff have been brought in to respond to people\u2019s calls. If your recycling has not been collected, contact the council\u2019s waste management team on 020 8583 5555.",

John Lambe, 23, and Matthew Evans, 25, both from Hounslow, appeared in court charged with theft and harassment after repeatedly taking money from the 58-year-old, who suffers from learning difficulties. He revealed he needed money after Lambe and Evans convinced him to hand over his benefit cheque. PC Doug Moore, of Hounslow safer neighbourhood team (SNT), issued the pair with a harassment warning notice to prevent them continuing their actions while he made further enquiries, and persuaded the victim to provide a statement. A month later the victim told police the pair had taken money from him and they were arrested. Lambe and Evans appeared at Feltham Magistrates\u2019 Court on November 18, where they pleaded not guilty and elected for trial at Crown Court. However, after the victim gave evidence at Kingston Crown Court, the men pleaded guilty. He is due to reappear at court on April 3.",

  "text": "Is East Sheen shop luckiest in borough? . An East Sheen shop could be the luckiest business in the borough after one customer walked out with a jackpot-winning lottery ticket. But the winner, believed to be a newly-made millionaire after winning a minimum of \u00a32.5m, will remain a mystery, after requesting to remain nameless with National Lottery operator Camelot. Jayshree Patel, who runs Moulton News, where the winning ticket was bought, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know who it is. They are anonymous, they don\u2019t want the publicity. \u201cWe got a call from the lottery people saying we had a winner of at least \u00a32.5m.\u201d The Upper Richmond Road West shop owner has proudly put up a poster notifying customers a winning ticket was bought in her store. Mrs Patel added: \u201cThe customers have said \u2018oh that\u2019s good, this is a lucky shop.\u2019 They are spreading it around. It is quite rare, especially around here.\u201d",

  "text": "Garden waste collection charge set to double. The cost of recycling green waste is set to double, affecting more than 10,000 residents. Previously residents could rent a 240 litre bin for a year from when they signed up and pay no extra for collection, or buy 110 litre green sacks for \u00a31 each, plus postage. But from Wednesday every resident signing up to the fortnightly green waste collection scheme or renewing their agreement will have to pay the increased price. The cost of the sacks is also rising to \u00a31.40 each. David Lawton, from the Teddington Society\u2019s environment group, called the rise \u201cinsensitive. He said: \u201cThe council\u2019s waste services are hardly viewed favourably across the borough. \u201cWith most residents already battling through the present financial crisis, this is a smack in the face for recycling too. \u201cDoes this administration really want us to recycle? This is the best deterrent the council could have dreamed up. \u201cRather than pay that extra \u00a330, residents will resort to the car and drive to Townmead with their green waste. \u201cPerhaps, at worst, they will stuff their black waste bags full, to add to the ever-increasing and overloaded landfill, or simply dump it as flytipping. \u201cIs this the green Richmond we really wish to encourage?\u201d A council spokesman said: \u201cThe \u00a330 annual charge, set in 2005, falls far short of covering running costs. \u201cTo avoid having to subsidise the service we have elected instead to increase the charge, so it is only those who use the service who pay for it. \u201cWe have made extra effort to contact residents whose hire contracts were due for renewal during February and March, so they could update their contracts before the new charges come into effect on April 1. \u201cResidents are encouraged to consider using home composting, which is the cheapest and most sustainable way to recycle green waste. \u201cThe free garden waste service at Townmead Road Recycling Centre in Kew continues to be available.\u201d",

A \u00a34.2m scheme designed to reduce cars on the roads and encourage people to embrace eco-friendly transport launched today. \u201cDespite its leafy image, Richmond faces the same challenges in terms of congestion and air pollution as other parts of London.\" The three-year scheme aims to encourage greater use of sustainable travel options, such as walking, cycling or using public transport, as well as reducing traffic congestion and improving the environment. Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: \u201cDespite its leafy image, Richmond faces the same challenges in terms of congestion and air pollution as other parts of London. \u201cThis scheme will help make the borough an even greener, healthier place for people to live and work. \u201cI can imagine nothing better than cycling through parts of Richmond, but this will mean that people across the borough will find it much easier to take to two wheels.\u201d The money will be used to create 450 new cycle parking spaces - 200 were installed before the official launch - two new cycle routes, new cycling facilities and car club bays, cycle training sessions and improve signage and mapping for pedestrians in Richmond and Twickenham town centres. There will also be the introduction of \u2018Walk on Wednesday\u2019 to all primary schools in the borough and the development of travel plans, and the provision of more information on sustainable transport to residents, schools and businesses. TfL\u2019s director for transport policy, Kulveer Ranger, added: \u201cUnderlying all of that, is TfL working with the borough to see how we can reduce our carbon footprint. \u201cEighty eight per cent of people who live in Richmond feel there is a problem with traffic, we know we cannot keep buying and using more and more cars.\u201d \u201cThis is a major initiative to ask people - residents, businesses and schools - to use sustainable transport which is smarter, better for the environment.\u201d",

  "text": "Council to wage war on graffiti. From next month, there will be twice as many graffiti squads patrolling streets in a bid to cut the problem in half, the council has said. Bosses are pledging to wage war on the unsightly scrawls - and are calling on residents to help them wipe it out by reporting graffiti whenever they spot it. According to Government indicators, up to 17 per cent of streets in Hounslow are affected by graffiti. Council cleaning squads will aim to remove the equivalent of 13 football pitches worth of graffiti in the next year alone. As he prepares to take to the streets to help a council cleaning crew on Tuesday, council leader, Peter Thompson, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve invested an extra \u00a3280,000 to help us wipe out graffiti across the borough, but we can\u2019t do it by ourselves. We need people to let us know when it appears so we can remove it quickly. \u201cPeople feel less safe in streets which are blighted by problems like graffiti. There is a clear link between antisocial behaviour like graffiti and fear of more serious crime. So, tackling this problem will really make Hounslow a better place to live. \"We want people to be proud of where they live, and not just accept graffiti as something they have to put up with. \u201cEveryone has the power to improve their area. If you\u2019re sick of graffiti then please pick up the phone and let us know. If you report it, we\u2019ll remove it.\u201d In 2006 there was just one council graffiti squad operating in the borough. From next month, this will increase to four. This latest crackdown comes as part of the council\u2019s campaign to \u201cbuild pride borough wide\u201d. A recent report by Keep Britain Tidy highlighted the importance of the council\u2019s campaign to wipe out graffiti. The report found people feel unsafe in areas which suffer from graffiti. The study also highlighted a possible \u201cclimate of resignation\u201d where residents were less likely to report problems like graffiti because they had come to accept them as the norm. Anyone who wants to report graffiti can contact the council\u2019s call centre on 020 8583 5555.",

  "text": "Cold winters may be new trend. After enduring the coldest winter in 16 years and now persistent below-normal temperatures that are chilling what should be spring, Richmondites can be excused for asking what gives. Meteorologists suspect coastal B.C. is now being nipped by a trend of colder than normal winter temperatures that could last a decade. Or two. Or three. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation is a phenomenon of alternating phases in which offshore ocean temperatures tend to run warmer and then colder\u2014for 20 to 30 years at a stretch. \u201cThere\u2019s some debate as to whether we\u2019ve slipped into a cold phase or not,\u201d said Environment Canada meteorologist Gabor Fricska. \u201cIt may be too early to say definitively.\u201d A warm Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase was measured from 1920-1945 followed by a cold phase that lasted until 1975, bringing the Lower Mainland many severe winters. Since then it\u2019s been a mixed bag: three cold years until 2002, then four more warmer years. But Fricska says some meteorologists think the recent spate of cold weather may be the onset of a new cold phase. \u201cIt is cold right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sea surface temperatures immediately off of our coast are one to two degrees below normal.\u201d Three out of the last four seasons (except last fall) have been colder than seasonal, he added. When a cold Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase is prevalent, winter low pressure systems in the Gulf of Alaska are often weaker than usual, allowing more cold air to come down to the coast from northern B.C. For anyone wanting proof of the hardship endured in the winter of 2008-09, Fricska offers these Metro Vancouver stats for December-January-February, from the airport weather station: It was the coldest winter since 1992-93 and the 10th coldest since record keeping began in 1937. Mean temperatures for the three months averaged 2.4 C, down from a normal of 3.6 degrees. Snowfall was more than two and a half times normal\u2014109 cms versus 42.5\u2014while rainfall was 35 per cent below normal. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t imagining things if they think it\u2019s colder,\u201d Fricska said. How could this be happening in an era of global warming? Fricska said Pacific Decadal Oscillations and shorter duration weather variations like El Nino are regional shifts that don\u2019t reflect what\u2019s happening at the planetary level. He noted B.C. experienced many of its coldest winters in recent memory during the cold oscillation cycle from 1945 to 1975\u2014even though global air temperatures climbed steadily during that period. Yet more snow fell this week at some higher elevations around the Lower Mainland. \u201cOur seasonal forecast for the spring is for continuing below normal temperatures on the coast,\u201d Fricska said.",

  "text": "Drowning victim identified. Police have identified the man who died in a sailing accident in the waters off Steveston March 16. Ronald Young, 56, died of drowning, the coroner has confirmed. Canadian Coast Guard's Dan Bate said a passing boater spotted a mast sticking out of the water shortly after 10 a.m. and a tugboat was dispatched to the scene and confirmed the presence of a sunken sailboat. The Canadian Coast Guard hovercraft Penac and a Cormorant helicopter were dispatched to the scene, and around 6:30 p.m. a body was found in the water. Bate said the body's proximity to the boat and the timing led searchers to conclude the two were linked. The eight-metre boat, the Apaleema, was found a couple of miles from Steveston Harbour, and the body was found about a mile from the boat. Foul play isn't suspected and there's no indication that there were any other victims of the boating mishap. The sailboat is not believed to have belonged to the victim, but was apparently loaned to him by a friend.",

  "text": "Iraqi Officials: Car Bomb Kills 20 in Baghdad. BAGHDAD \u2014 A car bomb exploded near a crowded market in a mainly Shiite area in Baghdad on Thursday, killing as many as 20 people, Iraqi officials said, in the fifth major attack in Iraq this month. The blast came a day after the U.S. military said overall attacks nationwide have fallen to levels of the early months of the war, which began with the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. The car was parked near a bus terminal surrounded by shops in the eastern Shaab district when it blew up shortly after noon on Thursday, the officials said. Iraqi police and hospital officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to release the information, said the 20 killed included four children and four women. The officials said 35 people also were wounded. The U.S. military confirmed the attack but said preliminary reports indicated eight people were killed and 14 were wounded. Conflicting casualty tolls are common in the aftermath of bombings. Shaab is a former Shiite militia stronghold that has seen a drop in violence since cleric Muqtada al-Sadr declared a cease-fire amid a crackdown by the U.S. and Iraqi militaries.",

  "text": "Freemason Bogdanov Joins Sochi Mayor Race. Former presidential candidate Andrei Bogdanov on Wednesday became the latest entry into the crowded Sochi mayoral election, saying the Black Sea resort could become \u201cthe Nice of Russia.\u201d Bogdanov, 39, is the former head of the now-defunct Democratic Party of Russia, which was widely seen as a Kremlin-controlled project to draw votes away from actual opposition candidates and give voters a tame liberal option. \u201cSochi should become the Nice of Russia, where the majority can earn a living through small businesses,\u201d Bogdanov told The Moscow Times on Wednesday after submitting his registration papers to the Sochi elections commission. The mayoral election in Sochi, which is slated to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, has become one of the year\u2019s most intriguing political events. Several high-profile candidates, including opposition politician Boris Nemtsov and businessman Alexander Lebedev, have already announced that they would run for the post. Bogdanov\u2019s bid brings to the election one of the country\u2019s most curious political actors. Though virtually unknown nationally, Bogdanov was the only independent candidate who managed to get on the ballot of the 2008 presidential election by collecting 2 million signatures to support his campaign. Critics call Bogdanov a Kremlin stooge and say his inclusion on the presidential ballot was merely a Kremlin move to have a token liberal in the election, which Dmitry Medvedev won by a landslide. Promising to make Russia an EU member, Bogdanov captured a measly 1.3 percent of the vote. Bogdanov, who also who heads up the country\u2019s largest Masonic lodge, told The Moscow Times by telephone Wednesday that he would again run as an independent in the Sochi election. Twenty-two candidates had applied to get on the ballot as of Wednesday, Interfax reported. The deadline to register for the April 26 election is Thursday. State Duma Deputy Andrei Lugovoi, who faces murder charges in Britain in connection with the 2006 poisoning death of Alexander Litvinenko in London, had expressed interest in running but announced this week that he would not enter the race. The United Russia candidate, acting Sochi Mayor Anatoly Pakhomov, is seen as a favorite in the election.",
