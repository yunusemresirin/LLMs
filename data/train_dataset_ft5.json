Grand Ledge Police Officers Chris Chester and Jason Barber responded to a report of a fire on the fifth floor of Serenity Place apartments, a senior citizen apartment complex at 216 S. Clinton Avenue, at 12:45 a.m. The officers arrived ahead of the responding fire engine and entered the building to start warning residents of the fire and assist them in evacuating. The fire was brought under control quickly, and a search of the apartment revealed equipment and materials consistent with the manufacture of methamphetamine, police said. Other similar materials were found adjacent to the site outside, officials said. Grand Ledge investigators interviewed the resident of the apartment and are looking for other people who may have been in the apartment at the time the fire started. State police units responded to the scene with specialized personnel and equipment to handle the hazardous materials. The scene has been turned over to state health officials to determine when displaced residents can return to the building. The Red Cross is assisting residents who have been displaced. This senior citizen residence in Grand Ledge was the scene of a criminal investigation when firefighters responding to a fire shortly after midnight discovered what appeared to be a meth lab.",

  "text": "Wilder\u2019s executive-protection unit involved in seven wrecks. Wilder's unit had seven wrecks from 2005 to'08 Richmond police officers blamed for three crashes but charged in none At 1:40 a.m. on a Thursday last October, a 2006 Mercury crashed into a deer on state Route 5 in Charles City County. The wreck caused $1,713 in damage to the car's front end but no injuries to its occupants. It's an accident that typically would get little notice, except it involved a Richmond Police Department unit assigned to provide 24-hour security to then-Mayor L. Douglas Wilder. It was one of seven, mostly minor wrecks involving vehicles of the executive-protection unit since it was established in 2005, according to police records released under a Virginia Freedom of Information Act request. The Charles City crash occurred Oct. 16 at Route 5 and Adkins Road, about 12 miles northwest of Wilder's estate on the James River. Wilder lived there before he moved back to Richmond to meet residency requirements to be mayor. Assessment records show he still owns the property. Of the seven wrecks, city officers were blamed for three but charged in none, according to police reports and Charles City Sheriff Javier J. Smith. Other drivers were faulted in three wrecks and charged in at least two. One driver was cited with an improper lane change and another with failure to yield and driving without a license. Typically, city police officers aren't charged in minor wrecks because \"internal discipline procedures generally carry greater consequences to the officers than the citation would,\" Victoria N. Pearson, general counsel for the police department, said in an e-mail. \"Additionally, all of our accidents are reviewed by a review board, which includes citizens who participate in the process of determining appropriate discipline.\" Citing confidential personnel issues, Pearson would not say whether any officers had been disciplined. The accident reports describe officers' vehicles bumping into the back of one car, sideswiping another, and hitting the bumper of yet another. Except for the one in Charles City, all the wrecks occurred in Richmond. Damage estimates ranged from $50 to $4,000 per incident and more than $12,000 overall. The most expensive wreck caused by a city officer cost $1,822, according to the police department. The wrecks happened from June 2005 to October 2008, before Dwight C. Jones took office in January and ordered cuts of at least 50 percents to the unit's staff and fleet. The wreck in Charles City wasn't significant enough to warrant a full report, and no charges were filed, Sheriff Smith said. Two Richmond officers were in the vehicle at the time, he said.",

FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- A busload of activists -- outnumbered 2-to-1 by reporters and photographers -- are paying visits to the homes of American International Group Inc. executives in Connecticut to protest tens of millions in bonuses awarded by the company. About 40 protesters parked at a cul-de-sac this afternoon and walked to the Fairfield home of Douglas Polling. They were met on the curb by two security guards, and one protester read a letter detailing the financial struggles that many Connecticut residents have faced. The group then left the note in Polling's mailbox. Polling already agreed to forfeit his bonus, but the protesters want AIG executives to do more to help working families.

  "text": "Kaine signs legislation to allow \u2018Choose Life\u2019 license plates. Gov. Timothy M. Kaine has signed legislation to permit \"Choose Life\" license plates. Virginia joins 23 other states that offer the plate -- some after lengthy court battles. Kaine's predecessor as governor, fellow Democrat Mark R. Warner, vetoed legislation to allow such a license plate in 2003. \"I sign this legislation today in keeping with the commonwealth's longtime practice of approving special plates with all manner of political and social messages,\" Kaine said in a statement. \"Furthermore, if Planned Parenthood -- an organization that is already a recipient of state budget funds -- or another similar organization ever chooses to seek a specialty license plate in Virginia, I believe the constitution would require the state to approve that plate to protect against any viewpoint discrimination.\" Sen. Ken Cuccinelli, R-Fairfax, attached the proposal onto a bill that also adds plates honoring the Washington Capitals, the Blue Ridge Parkway and others to the 200 specialty plates the Department of Motor Vehicles already offers. Under law, more than 350 people must sign up for a plate before DMV can produce it. Cuccinelli said 450 people have prepaid for the plate. After the first 1,000 plates are sold, $15 of the $25 fee would go to crisis pregnancy centers.",

  "text": "Meteor or piece of spacecraft caused fireball, boom, expert says. A fireball and big boom that people witnessed Sunday night could have been caused by a meteor or even a falling part from a Russian spacecraft, experts say. \"I know it's one of the two,\" said Geoff Chester, an astronomer and public relations officer with the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington. \"I just can't tell you definitively which one it actually was.\" People in parts of Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina reported a light similar to fireworks about 9:40 p.m., followed by an explosive sound. Chester suggested that a falling Russian booster rocket caused the hubbub. The booster -- a steel cylinder about 25 feet long and 8 feet wide -- was part of the Soyuz spacecraft that launched Thursday on a mission to the International Space Station. The booster was expected to fall toward Earth on a path, headed east, that would have taken it across the Chesapeake Bay region Sunday night, Chester said. The booster would have burned in the friction of the Earth's atmosphere and, as it slowed below the speed of sound, it would have released energy that caused a sonic boom, Chester said. \"My feeling is this is what people actually saw,\" Chester said. Stefan Bocchino, a spokesman for the Joint Space Operations Center at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, said experts there do not think the light was caused by a manmade object. The Joint Space Operations Center tracks manmade objects that enter the atmosphere. The National Weather Service has ruled out any weather-related cause. Other experts said the light and boom sound like the work of a meteor. Meteors are bits of space rock or gravel that burn and create light when they hit the atmosphere. \"Some very bright ones are known to explode,\" creating a sound, said Phillip Ianna, a professor emeritus of astronomy at the University of Virginia. Meteors typically burn up in the atmosphere. Much less often, a small piece of the rock will hit Earth. Steve Chesley, an astronomer with NASA, said the Sunday phenomenon could be the work of a meteor the size of a television set or small car. \"These kinds of things hit the [atmosphere] once a month,\" Chesley said. They usually fall over water or less-populated areas and attract less attention. NASA doesn't track such small objects, Chesley said, and focuses instead on big ones -- space rocks half the length of a football field or more -- that are headed toward Earth. \"It's the big ones we're worried about, and we need to find them decades in advance,\" Chesley said. The object on Sunday had to be unusually bright to be seen in urban areas, where artificial lights drown out most celestial objects, said David Hagan, a staff scientist with the Science Museum of Virginia. \"It had to be quite a phenomenon to be observed from Shockoe Bottom,\" Hagan said. Brian Munford, 43, of Richmond, was driving in Short Pump when he saw the light. \"It was like a Roman candle headed the wrong way, coming down. . . . It was pretty cool-looking.\" Chester, of the Naval Observatory, said objects burning in the sky can appear deceptively close when they actually are many miles away.",

  "text": "N.Va. murder suspect declared incompetent to stand trial. MANASSAS -- A Woodbridge man charged in the abduction and death of an Alexandria woman has been declared incompetent to stand trial and is awaiting treatment at a state mental-health hospital. Keith Baskerville -- the only survivor in the Sept. 13 event -- is charged with felony murder, abduction and carjacking charges in the death of 60-year-old Barbara Bosworth. This month, a judge in Prince William County Circuit Court declared Baskerville incompetent to stand trial and ordered him sent to Western State Hospital for treatment. Baskerville appeared in court Friday, when a judge was scheduled to review his case. But his review was continued after attorneys and the judge said Baskerville had not yet received the mental-health treatment ordered by the court. Baskerville is now due back in court April 24, when a judge will review his competency. Police said Baskerville and another man, 19-year-old Lutchman Chandler, abducted Bosworth from Springfield Mall in September and drove her to a PDQ Mart in Woodbridge, where they tried to use her ATM card to withdraw money. The men then left the store with Bosworth and crashed their car while fleeing the area. Chandler, who police said was driving the car at the time of the wreck, later died from his injuries. Judge Mary Grace O'Brien of Prince William Circuit Court said Baskerville's mental-health treatment had been delayed because she ordered him sent to Western State Hospital, though because of the nature of the crimes he is charged with, state laws require that he be sent to Central State Hospital. He had not been sent there before his court appearance Friday because of a lack of bed space at the hospital, O'Brien said. \"I don't want this case to fall through the cracks,\" O'Brien said before setting the April 24 court date.",

  "text": "York County man pleads guilty in attempted robbery; two others sentenced. Derek D. Moore, a key figure in a plan hatched by York County high school friends last year to rob a notorious drug dealer, is getting a taste of life behind bars. Judge Thomas B. Hoover of New Kent County Circuit Court revoked bond and sent the former Bruton High School student to jail yesterday after Moore pleaded guilty in the case and then tested positive for marijuana. Also, two other defendants in the case were sentenced yesterday. Out on bond since shortly after his arrest in October, Moore, 19, told the judge at first that he was clean, but after testing positive, offered that he may have picked up marijuana in his system from being with friends. That excuse reverberates through a case that ended with the shooting death of another Bruton student, Christopher Greene, in the Oct. 14 effort to rob John Steven Carter of drugs and guns at Carter's Lanexa home. Carter, 56, was using an alias and was on the run from drug charges in Florida; he apparently gunned down Greene as Greene broke through Carter's back door with a rifle, according to court documents. Carter disappeared but was arrested this month in Alabama after a monthslong search. He is facing drug, weapon and fugitive charges in Florida; it is uncertain whether he will be extradited back to Virginia. Moore, who helped arrange the plan to rob Carter and who drove to Lanexa on Oct. 14 with three other current or former Bruton students, lost his freedom yesterday and will be formally sentenced June 8. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery and attempted robbery; sentencing guidelines indicate he'll serve seven to 20 months in jail. Moore was best friends with Greene and came forward to police the day after Greene's death. \"What we know about this case comes from Mr. Moore,\" Commonwealth's Attorney C. Linwood Gregory told Hoover. Two other defendants in the case pleaded guilty yesterday to misdemeanor charges of being accessories to conspiracy and to attempted robbery. Robert T. Tynes Jr., described in a batch of letters of support as an outstanding young man with a limitless future, received a suspended 24-month sentence. Tynes accompanied others to Lanexa and drove the vehicle home that carried the young men, leaving Greene's body behind outside Carter's back door. A third defendant, Kodie L. Tyler, who passed up bond and has been in jail since October, received a 10-year sentence, with all but six months suspended. He pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy to commit grand larceny. The drug den operated by Carter housed a secret marijuana growing operation. Two 18-year-old acquaintances of Moore set the robbery in motion by telling him about Carter; Robert M. Perez drove Moore and Greene to Lanexa to check out the house the day before the robbery attempt. John W. Chaffin and Perez told Moore he could find \"pillowcases full\" of dope at Carter's, and a deal was struck to share proceeds of the heist. This month, Chaffin and Perez pleaded guilty to attempted petit larceny. Perez received a suspended 12-month sentence and Chaffin is serving six months. Chaffin was sent directly to jail after testing positive for cocaine.",

  "text": "Huckabee campaigns with McDonnell in Roanoke. ROANOKE -- Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee campaigned with Virginia gubernatorial candidate Bob McDonnell in Roanoke yesterday, helping him raise $50,000 and praising him as the Republican who can help restore the party's fortunes nationwide. Speaking to reporters, Huckabee, who lost to Arizona Sen. John McCain last year in his bid to win the Republican nomination for president, criticized those who say \"that the Republican Party has sort of already experienced its demise and that the funeral services are being planned in the near future.\" \"You come to places like Virginia and you see that with Bob McDonnell, we've got a very strong pulse,\" Huckabee said at the Shenandoah Club downtown. \"Cancel the memorial.\" McDonnell, who resigned as state attorney general to run for governor, opened his campaign Saturday by promising to create jobs and make Virginia a leading energy producer. McDonnell favors drilling for oil and gas off Virginia's shore and says he wants to cut red tape to make it easier to start a business in the state. State Democratic Party leaders responded to McDonnell's campaign kickoff by labeling him an obstructionist who is unable to work across party lines to carry out the business of Virginia. The lone Republican in the race for the governor's job, McDonnell is counting on Huckabee to help him raise cash for the impending battle with the winner of the Democratic nomination. Three candidates are running for the Democratic nod: former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe of McLean, former Del. Brian J. Moran of Alexandria and state Sen. R. Creigh Deeds of Bath County.",

  "text": "DNR tickets out-of-state boaters avoiding Ind. tax. HAMMOND, Ind. (AP) \u0097 The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is cracking down on out-of-state boaters who do not pay Indiana excise taxes. More than 300 people with boats moored in Hammond and East Chicago have been fined for failing to pay the tax. As many as 89 people could face fines of $500 and have their driver's licenses suspended for not acting on the tickets. Out-of-state residents can register their boats in their home state, but must pay Indiana excise taxes if they boat in Indiana. The recent crackdown was prompted in part by complaints by angry Indiana residents who pay the state's excise tax when they register their boats. ``These people felt they were being cheated,'' said DNR Lt. Jerry Shepherd. At the large Hammond Marina, about 85 percent of boaters live outside of Indiana. Port Authority Director Milan Kruszynski said ticketed boaters weren't happy, especially since they have to travel to Lowell Town Court if they want to contest the ticket. Of the more than 300 boaters cited in Hammond and East Chicago, between 150 and 200 refused to comply, contested or did not respond to the notice, said DNR Public Information Officer Shawn Brown. The Indiana General Assembly passed a law in 2006 to allow greater enforcement of the state's excise tax. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources launched a public education campaign to convince out-of-state boaters that Indiana is serious about collecting the tax.",

Officials in Warren County's Hamilton Township outside Cincinnati say the population spurt there is putting pressure on safety services and roadways. To cope with growth costs, the township imposed an impact fee on new development that led to a bitter and unresolved court challenge from home builders. Government officials also have changed a zoning code to limit the density of homes in rural areas.

It's been a while since school was cancelled due to this amount of accumulation. If you have the requisite bread and milk, feel free to turn your attention to locating a sled, some gloves and a hillside covered in snow. Sound simple? Well, it's Richmond and sledding options are a bit limited. There's a few hills, but it's hard to find a friend (or make a friend) with a decent decline in their backyard. In Henrico County, if a park is open you can use it for sled riding, just don't trespass on someone else's property, says a representative for Henrico County Police. Sledding is also permitted in Chesterfield County parks as long as park rules are followed, says Officer Morton with Chesterfield County Police. The biggest challenge may not be finding a park in Chesterfield County, but finding a hillside worthy of a sled. The winter storm has not been a long overdue play date for everyone. Travel is hazardous during a winter storm so take your time, slow down and keep plenty of distance between your vehicle and the one ahead of you.

  "text": "Army depot nominated for \u2018Freedom Award\u2019. The Blue Grass Army Depot was one of 46 Kentucky employers recently nominated to receive the 2009 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. Employers are nominated by their employees who serve in the Kentucky National Guard or military reserves. The nominated employers may have done a variety of things to make military life easier such as providing continued benefits while serving, differential pay and family assistance, along with other forms of support. \u201cWe are truly honored to have been nominated by our employees for this prestigious award,\u201d said Blue Grass Army Depot Commander Col. Joseph Tirone. \u201cWhile we strive to support our service members on the battlefield, we also recognize that many of our employees serve their country as Department of Army civilians at Blue Grass Army Depot and as National Guard and Reserve members. Supporting them both on and off the battlefield is key to our success,\u201d he said. The 2009 awards will be presented at a ceremony in Washington, D. C., Thursday, Sept. 17 at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Center. More than 3,200 National Guard and Reserve members from across the country nominated their employers for their support, according to a statement released Wednesday by Lt. Col. Michelle Barrett from the Office of the Secretary of Defense. A national selection board comprised of senior defense officials and business leaders will select up to 15 recipients for this year\u2019s award. Secretary of Defense William Perry authorized the first award in 1996 and presented it to Schneider National, McDonnell Douglas, United Parcel Service Central Florida District, Tektronix Inc. and National Life of Vermont. In the years since, more than 100 employers have received this prestigious award. The award was instituted by the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR). ESGR is a Department of Defense agency established in 1972 whose mission is to gain and maintain employer support for guard and reserve service by recognizing outstanding support, increasing awareness of the law and resolving conflicts through mediation. The nomination process is open to all guard and reserve personnel and their families, and applications are submitted online to the ESGR.",

  "text": "Flood uses Lincoln portrayer to illustrate talk. When author Bracelen Flood speaks, he rarely has a Lincoln impersonator to use as a prop. However, as the author addressed a crowd of more than 220 Wednesday evening in the Grand Reading Room of Eastern Kentucky University\u2019s library, Flood called upon living history portrayer Bob Coffey to illustrate a scene depicted in his latest book, \u201c1864: Lincoln at the Gates of History.\u201d When the 12,000-man force of Confederate Gen. Jubal Early threatened the capital, coming to within five miles of the White House, Lincoln visited the capital\u2019s defenders at Fort Stevens, about five miles from the White House. Climbing upon the fort\u2019s parapet, the 6-foot, 4-inch Lincoln, wearing his trademark stovepipe hat, presented a 7-foot silhouette at which Confederate snipers could aim. To illustrate, Flood asked Coffey to stand. The Rockcastle County resident is the same height as Lincoln and almost the same age as the president was in 1864. Wearing a stovepipe hat, Coffey appeared giant-like to the audience. In contrast, the average Union soldier\u2019s height was only 5 feet, 6 inches. Lincoln probably is the only U.S. president to come under war-time fire while in office, Flood said. Captured Confederates later said their snipers recognized Lincoln\u2019s unmistakable profile, but all of their bullets missed the president who would be felled by an assassin\u2019s bullet the following year after the soldiers\u2019 guns had fallen silent. Lincoln lived long enough, however, to stiffen the nation\u2019s resolve in the face of military disasters, win re-election and see the Union to victory, Flood said. \u201cHow did Lincoln get his reputation for honesty?\u201d a questioner asked after Flood\u2019s address. Alluding to scandals of the past 35 years that have sent three Illinois governors to prison and led to another\u2019s indictment and impeachment, \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard for an Illinois politician to acquire a reputation for honesty,\u201d Flood said to much laughter. An elementary school student asked Flood what he found most interesting about Lincoln. The president set aside three hours every day for citizens to meet him in his office, Flood said. \u201cHe would see about 50 people each day in the order they arrived, regardless of who they were,\u201d the author said. Lincoln also had every letter sent to him answered, and penned a few answers himself. Those gestures allowed visitors from all over the country, even from as far as California, to see \u201cThere was a real person in the White House who care about them,\u201d Flood said. That helped stiffened the nation\u2019s spine when many in the North were ready to give up on the war, he said. Flood\u2019s presentation took place in the library where he has researched four books over the past 35 years. \u201cI am (in the Library) so much of the time that I regard the staff as my friends,\u201d Flood wrote in the acknowledgments of the Lincoln book. The nationally acclaimed writer has worked in some of the nation\u2019s largest and most prestigious libraries, including the Library of Congress, the Harvard University library and the New York Public Library. \u201cWhat I have (at EKU) makes me competitive with people working in any university or large public library anywhere in the country,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in a room at New York Public Library reserved for writers, called the Frederick Lewis Allen Writers\u2019 Room,\u201d the Manhattan native and Harvard graduate said. \u201cI can tell you what I have (at EKU) works better for me than what I had at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue (in New York City).\u201d To express his gratitude to the library, Flood said he agreed to serve as president of the Friends of the EKU Libraries in 2006-08. \u201cHe was the leader who spearheaded the revitalization of the group,\u201d said Carrie Cooper, dean of EKU\u2019s libraries. \u201cWe began with a handful of supporters from years past and now have nearly 200 members of our friends group thanks to Bracelen\u2019s leadership.\u201d Cooper said her staff feels privileged to assist a writer of Flood\u2019s caliber and is inspired his dedication to his work. \u201cHe is in the library many days as soon as the doors open and often doesn\u2019t leave until late into the evening,\u201d she said. \u201cHe eats lunch with our staff, celebrates their achievements, both personally and professionally, and has made many dear friends within our organization.\u201d Co-sponsored by the Friends of Madison County Public Library and Friends of the EKU Libraries, Wednesday\u2019s event also featured an exhibit of Civil War documents, including a Lincoln letter from the university\u2019s archives, a pass the president signed for a Kentucky civilian to go through Union lines at Louisville and a parole for a Union soldier and member of the Kentucky Home Guard who was captured at the Battle of Richmond. Bill Robinson can be reached at brobinson@richmondregister.com or at 624-6622.

The Madison Central High School mock trial team won the state championship Sunday, defeating Eastern High School of Louisville in the final round. Senior Kasey Anderson was named the tournament\u2019s best attorney, while Junior Matt Bendure won best witness. MCHS will represent Kentucky in the national tournament to take place May 8-9 in Atlanta. Central was one of four Madison County teams in the tournament. Only Jefferson County, with seven, had more schools represented in the in the 26-team competition. Madison Southern High School and Model Laboratory School, along with Foley Middle School, took part in the tournament. Foley Middle, which earlier won its state tournament, was invited to participate and won one round before being eliminated. \u201cAll four teams represented Madison County very well,\u201d said Madison Circuit Judge William G. Clouse Jr., who helps coach the MCHS team. \u201cThe Foley team received very complimentary remarks from the judges during of its evaluations.\u201d Central defeated McLean County, Louisville Assumption, the Montgomery County blue team and the C.M. Gatton Academy of Math and Science before facing Eastern in the finals. Draws determined whether competitors would represent the prosecution or defense in the case of a defendant accused of selling marijuana on school property. In the finals, Central\u2019s team successfully argued the defendant was not guilty, based on police entrapment, Clouse said. The competition, conducted in the Jefferson County Judicial Center, was judged by judges from the Kentucky Court of Appeals, circuit and district judges, attorneys and law students. \u201cWe have an exceptional group of students on our 12-member team,\u201d Clouse said, \u201cand they have worked extremely hard.\u201d Clouse\u2019s daughter, Kristin, a senior at the University of Kentucky College of Law, and Robin Lake, a senior at Chase Law School, are the attorney coaches for MCHS. Vicki Rollins is the faculty coach. The team will begin preparing today for the national competition, Judge Clouse said. \u201cKentucky has an outstanding reputation in the mock trial world and several schools already have sent us e-mails wanting to conduct practice scrimmages with Central after we get to Atlanta before the competition,\u201d he said.

  "text": "Creating a rain garden. The Kit Carson Elementary School ecology club is putting in a flower garden. It will not be just any garden, however. \u201cThis will a rain garden, designed and constructed to decrease and filter storm water runoff,\u201d said Tammy Ritchison, the club\u2019s parent co-sponsor. The garden will be planted only with native plants that put down deep roots, making them drought resistant and enhancing the garden\u2019s filtration capabilities. Rain gardens are planted in depressions, dug about 10 to 18 inches below the surrounding surface, Ritchison said. \u201cThat allows them to capture storm runoff,\u201d she said. Water stands no more than two days in a rain garden because a mixture of organic material and/or sand is added to allow drainage. Scott Darst, Madison County extension agent for youth development, visited Kit Carson Elementary on Wednesday to help club members conduct a soil percolation test, to determine how their rain garden\u2019s soil should be treated to ensure drainage. If properly designed and constructed, a rain garden will capture 90 percent of the precipitation dropped by a typical Kentucky rain. \u201cSome people fear that mosquitoes will lay eggs in the water collected by a rain garden,\u201d Ritchison said. \u201cMosquitoes will lay eggs in the water, but the eggs do not hatch for seven days. Because the rain garden pools drain in two days, the mosquito eggs die. That actually helps reduce the mosquito population.\u201d The native wildflowers and grasses prescribed for a rain garden not only are beautiful, the seeds they produce attract birds that eat mosquitoes and other pests, she said. One plant native to Kentucky, the butterfly milkweed, will attract monarch butterflies to a rain garden, because the milkweed is the only plant in which the large orange and black butterfly lays its eggs. The students will plant their garden on Earth Day, April 22. The project is being funded with by a $500 grant from the Bluegrass Rain Garden Alliance. Ecology club members raised an additional $650 by selling candygrams for Valentine\u2019s Day, Ritchison said. The school\u2019s ecology club, which started three years ago with eight members, today includes more than 75 students from third through fifth grades. Teachers Vivian Bowles and Stacey Wills are the faculty co-sponsors. To help fulfill its grant obligations to the rain garden alliance, Kit Carson Elementary will conduct an April 18 rain garden workshop for teachers and other adults. In addition to providing instruction on rain garden design, the workshop will cover curriculum development and lesson plans, plus hands-on gardening activities. To register, send an e-mail to Brittany Zwicker by Friday at brittany@kentuckypride.com with attendee\u2019s name, lunch preference, school name/organization and subjects taught.

A Richmond man was charged early Sunday morning with driving under the influence and three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment after Richmond police say he struck a car stopped along Interstate 75 with a flat tire. Evan P. King, 24, of Campbell Branch Road, was weaving back and forth while driving northbound on I-75 near mile marker 89 around 2 a.m. Sunday, Richmond Police Department spokesman Sgt. Willard Reardon said in a news release. King then struck a car containing a family of three which was stopped on the side of the road with a flat tire, Reardon said. The father was attempting to change the tire while the mother and an infant in a car seat were inside the vehicle, Reardon said. The mother suffered head and leg injuries and was transported to Pattie A. Clay Regional Medical Center, Reardon said. The severity of her injuries is unknown. The infant and the father were uninjured in the crash, which slowed traffic along the interstate for 30 to 45 minutes. King was lodged in the Madison County Detention Center following the accident. He is free on a $5,000 cash bond, jail officials said Monday. City tools takenA thief stole more than $2,600 in tools from the City of Richmond\u2019s public works department Friday. Employees at the department\u2019s E. Walnut Street offices discovered Friday morning that someone had used an office window to break into the building and made off with a number of tools, Reardon said. Missing are three Stihl chainsaws, three bull floats, five bull float handles, a Milwaukee brand hammer drill, a power post-hole digger, an auger and a handheld Stihl concrete saw, all valued at $2,681. The thief also damaged a Pepsi vending machine while attempting to break into it, Reardon said. Other crimes Two leaf blowers were reported stolen Friday by the owner of Silver Cliff Landscaping. The backpack-style Stihl blowers were taken from a truck being used at St. Andrews Retirement Community and were valued at $1,000. More than $2,500 in electronics were reported stolen Monday morning from an apartment in the 100 block of O\u2019Roark Avenue. The residents told police someone had cut the screen from the storm door and manipulated the lock during the early morning hours to break into the home. Missing were a Sony PlayStation 3, an XBox 360, games for both systems, 60 to 70 DVDs and two Dell Inspiron laptop computers. The items were valued at $2,550. A Louisiana man was arrested for carrying a concealed deadly weapon Sunday following a traffic stop near the Eastern Bypass. Sean Clouthier, 22, of Sulpher, La., was stopped at the intersection of Lancaster Avenue and the Eastern Bypass for a traffic stop, and a search of his vehicle uncovered a loaded 9mm pistol and a loaded .45-caliber pistol in the vehicle\u2019s console. A wallet was reported stolen Saturday from an unlocked car parked outside the Pink Flamingo Laundromat on Big Hill Avenue. The wallet was later recovered near Advance Auto Parts, but $108 in cash had been taken. Gabriel Shearer, 34, of Richmond, was arrested Saturday for misdemeanor theft by unlawful taking after Walmart employees detained him for allegedly taking $33 in merchandise from the store. Anyone with information about these crimes is asked to call the Richmond Police Department at 623-1162 or 623-8911. Brian Smith may be reached at bsmith@richmondregister.com or at 624-6694.",

  "text": "Police determine details of three-vehicle crash. Law enforcement could not say for sure Friday night how a three-vehicle injury accident on KY 52 occurred, but Sgt. Sam Manley from the Madison County Sheriff\u2019s Department confirmed Monday the sequence of events that sent all five people involved to the hospital with injuries. A 2005 black Ford truck being driven by Joseph Welch of Richmond was about to turn right (westbound) onto KY 52 heading toward Richmond, Manley said. A 1993 brown Cadillac driven by Larry Dunaway of Berea was traveling westbound and struck the pickup truck in the left rear, the deputy said. That then caused the truck to do a 180-degree spin, and it was left facing east in a westbound lane, Manley said. By that time, Manley said the Cadallic was facing west in the eastbound lane resulting in a head-on collision between an eastbound 1996 Chevrolet driven by David Arvin of Irvine. Arvin, Dunaway and his passenger, Barton Jones of Waco, were treated at the University of Kentucky Medical Center and were in \u201ccritical but stable\u201d condition, according to a UK spokesperson who gave the statement Saturday afternoon. Welch and his passenger Vickie Nguyen were taken to Pattie A. Clay Medical Center where they were treated for minor injuries.",

The woman described the man who shoved her to the ground and stole her purse as a tall, large male wearing a dark or gray hooded sweatshirt, Clark said. The man fled the scene as a passenger in a green car. Clark said the woman was outside smoking behind the complex when the suspect pushed her to the ground, causing cuts to her knees and hands. \u201cThat\u2019s why we made it a robbery first (degree), because the statute says if someone\u2019s injured,\u201d Clark said.

Grant W. Graham, 27, of the 1000 block of Brooklyn Boulevard, was stopped by Walmart employees around 7 p.m. Sunday for allegedly attempting to take merchandise from the store.

Teething problems to the council\u2019s new waste collection services saw thousands of borough residents left with recycling piling up outside their homes. Filled recycling boxes in streets across the borough remained untouched as the council\u2019s new recycling contractor\u2019s SITA were nowhere to be seen last week. Since the two-week old service came into effect Hounslow Labour councillors revealed they have been repeatedly contacted by unhappy residents. Complaints have included the non-collection of recycling, non-delivery and loss of containers and emptied containers strewn across garden paths and pavements. Brentford ward councillor Ruth Cadbury said: \u201cThe numbers of complaints have rocketed and this means that people will be put off recycling. \u201cThis is terrible news for the environment, and will cost our council tax payers money as more waste goes to land-fill.\u201d At the time the council said it believed the system, which saw new containers for paper, plastic and food waste being dropped off at homes in the borough, would make it easier for residents to recycle more of their household waste. Hounslow\u2019s lead member for environment and planning, Councillor Barbara Reid, apologised this week for the failures of the service and said that she was taking the problem very seriously. She said: \u201dI want to say sorry for those residents that have been inconvenienced and give them my assurance that we are on the case. \u201cIt\u2019s so important as recycling really is a top priority for us. There has been a huge response for from the public and that\u2019s not a problem. That\u2019s exactly what we want and we will respond to their enthusiasm. We are taking this very seriously.\u201d Coun Reid said the problems had arisen after SITA had under estimated the waste and the logistics of the collection. An extra team have been commissioned to help with collections while extra staff have been brought in to respond to people\u2019s calls. If your recycling has not been collected, contact the council\u2019s waste management team on 020 8583 5555.",

He revealed he needed money after Lambe and Evans convinced him to hand over his benefit cheque. PC Doug Moore, of Hounslow safer neighbourhood team (SNT), issued the pair with a harassment warning notice to prevent them continuing their actions while he made further enquiries, and persuaded the victim to provide a statement. A month later the victim told police the pair had taken money from him and they were arrested. Lambe and Evans appeared at Feltham Magistrates\u2019 Court on November 18, where they pleaded not guilty and elected for trial at Crown Court. However, after the victim gave evidence at Kingston Crown Court, the men pleaded guilty. He is due to reappear at court on April 3.",

  "text": "Garden waste collection charge set to double. The cost of recycling green waste is set to double, affecting more than 10,000 residents. Previously residents could rent a 240 litre bin for a year from when they signed up and pay no extra for collection, or buy 110 litre green sacks for \u00a31 each, plus postage. But from Wednesday every resident signing up to the fortnightly green waste collection scheme or renewing their agreement will have to pay the increased price. The cost of the sacks is also rising to \u00a31.40 each. David Lawton, from the Teddington Society\u2019s environment group, called the rise \u201cinsensitive. He said: \u201cThe council\u2019s waste services are hardly viewed favourably across the borough. \u201cWith most residents already battling through the present financial crisis, this is a smack in the face for recycling too. \u201cDoes this administration really want us to recycle? This is the best deterrent the council could have dreamed up. \u201cRather than pay that extra \u00a330, residents will resort to the car and drive to Townmead with their green waste. \u201cPerhaps, at worst, they will stuff their black waste bags full, to add to the ever-increasing and overloaded landfill, or simply dump it as flytipping. \u201cIs this the green Richmond we really wish to encourage?\u201d A council spokesman said: \u201cThe \u00a330 annual charge, set in 2005, falls far short of covering running costs. \u201cTo avoid having to subsidise the service we have elected instead to increase the charge, so it is only those who use the service who pay for it. \u201cWe have made extra effort to contact residents whose hire contracts were due for renewal during February and March, so they could update their contracts before the new charges come into effect on April 1. \u201cResidents are encouraged to consider using home composting, which is the cheapest and most sustainable way to recycle green waste. \u201cThe free garden waste service at Townmead Road Recycling Centre in Kew continues to be available.\u201d",

Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: \u201cDespite its leafy image, Richmond faces the same challenges in terms of congestion and air pollution as other parts of London. \u201cThis scheme will help make the borough an even greener, healthier place for people to live and work. \u201cI can imagine nothing better than cycling through parts of Richmond, but this will mean that people across the borough will find it much easier to take to two wheels.\u201d The money will be used to create 450 new cycle parking spaces - 200 were installed before the official launch - two new cycle routes, new cycling facilities and car club bays, cycle training sessions and improve signage and mapping for pedestrians in Richmond and Twickenham town centres. There will also be the introduction of \u2018Walk on Wednesday\u2019 to all primary schools in the borough and the development of travel plans, and the provision of more information on sustainable transport to residents, schools and businesses.

Bosses are pledging to wage war on the unsightly scrawls - and are calling on residents to help them wipe it out by reporting graffiti whenever they spot it. According to Government indicators, up to 17 per cent of streets in Hounslow are affected by graffiti. Council cleaning squads will aim to remove the equivalent of 13 football pitches worth of graffiti in the next year alone.

We need people to let us know when it appears so we can remove it quickly. \u201cPeople feel less safe in streets which are blighted by problems like graffiti. There is a clear link between antisocial behaviour like graffiti and fear of more serious crime. So, tackling this problem will really make Hounslow a better place to live. \"We want people to be proud of where they live, and not just accept graffiti as something they have to put up with. \u201cEveryone has the power to improve their area. If you\u2019re sick of graffiti then please pick up the phone and let us know.

A recent report by Keep Britain Tidy highlighted the importance of the council\u2019s campaign to wipe out graffiti. The report found people feel unsafe in areas which suffer from graffiti. The study also highlighted a possible \u201cclimate of resignation\u201d where residents were less likely to report problems like graffiti because they had come to accept them as the norm.

A Delta police officer has been called to testify at the public inquiry into the death of Polish immigrant Robert Dziekanski following a 2007 confrontation with RCMP officers at Vancouver International Airport. Dziekanski died after he was shocked several times by a Taser wielded by RCMP Const. Kwesi Millington, one of four airport police who said Dziekanski was hit with the high-voltage electrical stun gun because he was acting in a threatening manner. Following the incident, the RCMP asked the Delta Police Department\u2019s firearms expert Const. Craig Baltzer to examine the Taser that was fired at Dziekanski by Millington. Baltzer downloaded information from a computer chip that is included with each Taser designed to record every discharge of the device. The constable will give evidence about his findings when the public inquiry chaired by Thomas Braidwood resumes on March 23. The Delta officer is expected to take the stand some time after RCMP Cpl. Benjamin Robinson, one of the four airport officers and the supervisor on duty at the time Dziekanski died. Before the inquiry took a two-week break, it heard the RCMP officer who fired the Taser admit that he\u2019d made erroneous statements in his report about the deadly encounter. Millington originally stated that Dziekanski had to be repeatedly shocked because he didn\u2019t immediately fall to the ground. But a video taken by a witness shows that Dziekanski did fall to the ground when stunned. Millington also denied the officers had met to discuss the incident, even though one of his colleagues said they had. And he told the inquiry he never overheard his fellow officers discuss the incident. Millington was the only officer armed with a Taser, and had only recently been trained in its use. He also said he didn\u2019t issue a warning to Dziekanski that he was going to use the Taser because he felt he didn\u2019t have time and that Dziekanski, who was holding a stapler, was posing a threat to himself and the other officers. Dziekanski died in the international arrivals area of Vancouver International Airport after spending more than 10 hours waiting for his mother Zofia Cisowski.",

An estimated 21 per cent of area residents are aware pharmacies take back unused medicine, non-prescription drugs, as well as vitamins, minerals and herbal supplements. That's too low, say Metro Vancouver officials, who are aiming to boost participation in the free Medications Return Program. Pharmaceuticals that end up in landfills or in the sewer system can make their way into the environment. There it's feared they can poison or disrupt hormone levels and normal reproductive cycles in aquatic life, and potentially contribute to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Metro Vancouver already banned the disposal of pharmaceuticals from landfill disposal last year. Eliminating expired or unwanted drugs from medicine cabinets also ensures they aren't someday consumed by accident. About 40 tonnes of prescription and over-the-counter drugs are safely returned to pharmacies for safe disposal each year.",

  "text": "Cold winters may be new trend. After enduring the coldest winter in 16 years and now persistent below-normal temperatures that are chilling what should be spring, Richmondites can be excused for asking what gives. Meteorologists suspect coastal B.C. is now being nipped by a trend of colder than normal winter temperatures that could last a decade. Or two. Or three. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation is a phenomenon of alternating phases in which offshore ocean temperatures tend to run warmer and then colder\u2014for 20 to 30 years at a stretch. \u201cThere\u2019s some debate as to whether we\u2019ve slipped into a cold phase or not,\u201d said Environment Canada meteorologist Gabor Fricska. \u201cIt may be too early to say definitively.\u201d A warm Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase was measured from 1920-1945 followed by a cold phase that lasted until 1975, bringing the Lower Mainland many severe winters. Since then it\u2019s been a mixed bag: three cold years until 2002, then four more warmer years. But Fricska says some meteorologists think the recent spate of cold weather may be the onset of a new cold phase. \u201cIt is cold right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sea surface temperatures immediately off of our coast are one to two degrees below normal.\u201d Three out of the last four seasons (except last fall) have been colder than seasonal, he added. When a cold Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase is prevalent, winter low pressure systems in the Gulf of Alaska are often weaker than usual, allowing more cold air to come down to the coast from northern B.C. For anyone wanting proof of the hardship endured in the winter of 2008-09, Fricska offers these Metro Vancouver stats for December-January-February, from the airport weather station: It was the coldest winter since 1992-93 and the 10th coldest since record keeping began in 1937. Mean temperatures for the three months averaged 2.4 C, down from a normal of 3.6 degrees. Snowfall was more than two and a half times normal\u2014109 cms versus 42.5\u2014while rainfall was 35 per cent below normal. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t imagining things if they think it\u2019s colder,\u201d Fricska said. How could this be happening in an era of global warming? Fricska said Pacific Decadal Oscillations and shorter duration weather variations like El Nino are regional shifts that don\u2019t reflect what\u2019s happening at the planetary level. He noted B.C. experienced many of its coldest winters in recent memory during the cold oscillation cycle from 1945 to 1975\u2014even though global air temperatures climbed steadily during that period. Yet more snow fell this week at some higher elevations around the Lower Mainland. \u201cOur seasonal forecast for the spring is for continuing below normal temperatures on the coast,\u201d Fricska said.",

Ronald Young, 56, died of drowning, the coroner has confirmed. Canadian Coast Guard's Dan Bate said a passing boater spotted a mast sticking out of the water shortly after 10 a.m. and a tugboat was dispatched to the scene and confirmed the presence of a sunken sailboat. The Canadian Coast Guard hovercraft Penac and a Cormorant helicopter were dispatched to the scene, and around 6:30 p.m. a body was found in the water. Bate said the body's proximity to the boat and the timing led searchers to conclude the two were linked. The eight-metre boat, the Apaleema, was found a couple of miles from Steveston Harbour, and the body was found about a mile from the boat. Foul play isn't suspected and there's no indication that there were any other victims of the boating mishap. The sailboat is not believed to have belonged to the victim, but was apparently loaned to him by a friend.",

MOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s membership in the Council of Europe is not threatened by sanctions, despite Moscow\u2019s continued refusal to ratify two key human rights protocols, two of the council\u2019s top politicians said Wednesday. Luc van den Brande and Theodoros Pangalos, who monitor Russia\u2019s compliance with its commitments to the council, said talk of sanctions against Moscow was groundless and that they hoped that the State Duma would soon ratify the outstanding protocols. \u201cI do not like sanctions. It is important that Russia is not marginalized,\u201d van den Brande told reporters after two days of talks with government officials and Duma deputies. Russia has irked many in the 47-member council by being the only country that has not ratified two amendments to the European Convention on Human Rights. Protocol 6 requires signatories to restrict the use of the death penalty to times of war. Protocol 14 stipulates reforms for the European Court of Human Rights. Pangalos, a former Greek foreign minister and Socialist member of parliament, complained that Russia\u2019s obstinacy was hampering the development of the whole council. He questioned arguments by Russian officials that public opinion was not ready for a formal abolition of capital punishment by pointing out that it was no longer carried out. \u201cWhy do you not apply it and at the same time say it is approved by the population?\u201d he asked. Russia has maintained a moratorium on the death penalty since 1996, when it joined the Council of Europe. Pangalos said the nonratification of the protocol for reforming the European Court of Human Rights was even stranger given that officials in the Justice Ministry told him that they were in favor of ratification. \u201cThe ball is in the field of the Duma,\u201d he said. The proposed reforms seek to improve the court\u2019s efficiency by filtering out cases that have less chance of succeeding. Konstantin Kosachyov, chairman of the Duma\u2019s International Relations Committee, criticized the protocol as ineffective. \u201cIt has many shortcomings and won\u2019t lead to real reform,\u201d he said late Tuesday, Interfax reported.",

  "text": "Russian artists in America. Generations of Russian artists who emigrated to the U.S. are on display at the Russian Museum. David Burliuk\u2019s \u2018Portrait of Professor Nicholas K. Roerich\u2019 (1929) is one of the items displayed. In David Burliuk\u2019s \u201cHudson,\u201d a view of the New York City skyline seems to fly apart into ribbons of image and memory like a fleeting dream. But for Burliuk and the other Russian emigre artists featured in a new exhibition at the Russian Museum, America was a tangible reality that strongly influenced the development of their art, as demonstrated by Burliuk\u2019s departure from his earlier work in \u201cHudson.\u201d The traveling exhibition, titled \u201cAmerican Artists from the Russian Empire,\u201d includes 45 artists who left Russia or the Soviet Union for America in the first half of the 20th century, and is the first time such a cast of artists has been assembled. \u201cSome go together, some don\u2019t,\u201d said Yevgenia Petrova, deputy director of the State Russian Museum and the project\u2019s main creative force. \u201cIt\u2019s a cross-section of what went on in Russian-American art up to the middle of the 20th century.\u201d This schizophrenic amalgam of paintings and sculptures runs the gamut from Neo-classicism to Abstract art and includes several generations of artists, from Cubo-futurist Max Weber to Alexander Liberman. The idea came from a 2003 exhibition of Russians who emigrated to France. The American-based Foundation for International Arts and Education organized the exhibition, drawing from museums, galleries and private collections in the U.S. The show made its debut at the Fred Jones Jr. Museum at the University of Oklahoma this spring, and will return to San Diego after a two-month run at Moscow\u2019s Tretyakov Gallery this summer. Its appearance in St. Petersburg marks the first time these works have been shown in Russia. \u201cFor the American public, the goal is to remind viewers that these artists had Russian roots, to point out what they brought from Russia to American art, and what from American art influenced them,\u201d Petrova said. In Russia, the exhibition aims to familiarize viewers with new art. \u201cFor [these artists], showing in Russia was impossible because of the Iron Curtain; it wasn\u2019t patriotic to show such work,\u201d Petrova said. American visitors will likely know artists like Mark Rothko, whose distinctive abstract style featuring solid blocks of color has become an icon of American art. Russian art-lovers, on the other hand, may know Boris Grigoryev, whose striking, slightly off-kilter portraits and depictions of peasant life have been extensively exhibited in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. The first wave of Russian artists to move to America was mainly made up of Jews who left before the Bolshevik Revolution, seeking chances to exhibit and study art after suffering anti-Semitism in Russia. \u201cThey left to obtain an education and gain freedom,\u201d Petrova said. Life in the Jewish Pale denied these artists a chance to show their work or communicate with kindred spirits on the international art scene, she explained. After the revolution, many more artists fled in the face of violence, starvation and political persecution during the Civil War and under the Soviet regime. \u201cThey left \u2026 to avoid prison and stay alive, but also to keep working; they didn\u2019t want to take part in Socialist realism,\u201d Petrova said. Once in the United States, Russian artists were exposed to fluid, \u201ccontagious\u201d new influences that profoundly affected their work, Petrova said. \u201cThe Burliuk painting of New York is so unexpected for Burliuk, it shows how strongly American art influenced these artists,\u201d she said. At the same time, the Russian artists influenced their American counterparts and retained something distinctly Russian in their work. Petrova pointed to surrealist painter Pavel Tchelitchew, who is included in the exhibition, and how his overarching aesthetic resembled that of Pavel Filonov, who remained in Russia. Although the two men most likely didn\u2019t know each other\u2019s work, they arrived at similar ideas on \u201cwhat\u2019s close to man in nature\u201d thanks to a shared background in Russian natural philosophy, she said. Shannon and Julie Ward, visiting from Los Angeles, said the exhibition showcased the ties between Russian and American art. \u201cThere\u2019s really a lot of crossover; American artists looked like Russians and vice versa,\u201d Julie said. \u201cAmerican Artists from the Russian Empire\u201d runs through June at the State Russian Museum, 4 Inzhenernaya Ulitsa, M: Gostiny Dvor.

BAGHDAD \u2014 A car bomb exploded near a crowded market in a mainly Shiite area in Baghdad on Thursday, killing as many as 20 people, Iraqi officials said, in the fifth major attack in Iraq this month. The blast came a day after the U.S. military said overall attacks nationwide have fallen to levels of the early months of the war, which began with the U.S.-led invasion in March 2003. The car was parked near a bus terminal surrounded by shops in the eastern Shaab district when it blew up shortly after noon on Thursday, the officials said. Iraqi police and hospital officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to release the information, said the 20 killed included four children and four women. The officials said 35 people also were wounded. The U.S. military confirmed the attack but said preliminary reports indicated eight people were killed and 14 were wounded. Conflicting casualty tolls are common in the aftermath of bombings. Shaab is a former Shiite militia stronghold that has seen a drop in violence since cleric Muqtada al-Sadr declared a cease-fire amid a crackdown by the U.S. and Iraqi militaries.",

  "text": "Eight Alleged Plotters Detained in Georgia. TBILISI, Georgia \u2014 A Georgian court ruled Wednesday that eight opposition supporters accused of plotting a coup and terrorist acts should remain in custody for two months as they await trial. Police released video recordings this week allegedly showing the men trying to buy weapons with the intent of causing violence during opposition protests next month. Most of those sent to detention are supporters of the party of Nino Burdzhanadze, a former parliamentary speaker who once was one of President Mikheil Saakashvili\u2019s closest allies. Burdzhanadze broke with Saakashvili last year and now is one of the key figures in the call for big rallies on April 9 that will demand that Saakashvili step down. The saga has echoes of 2007, when the government accused opposition figures, based partly on video evidence, of trying to stage a coup during opposition protests that were smashed by police. On Wednesday, officials released more recordings of alleged coup plans by opposition members. One recording purportedly shows a member of Burdzhanadze\u2019s party, Roina Bukhrashvili, as saying that a civil war would be in the party\u2019s interests. Dissatisfaction with Saakashvili has grown since a brief but devastating war with Russia last August.",

  "text": "Debates Reflect Anti-Gay Feeling. As the Week Against Homophobia gets underway in St. Petersburg and several other Russian cities, Wednesday\u2019s debates at Sochi music bar showed that gay rights activists have a long way to go to overcome the superstitions. One of the two participants, Mikhail Potepkin of the Kremlin-backed youth movement Nashi, who described himself as \u201chomonegativist,\u201d compared homosexuality to necrophilia and bestiality and said that as a member of a sexual majority, he has the right not to see gay people on Nevsky Prospekt, St. Petersburg\u2019s main street. Potepkin\u2019s supporters reacted by giggling and applauding his jokes, and in subsequent discussions in the blogosphere, his views were largely considered to be \u201cmoderate.\u201d But Valery Sozayev, chairman of the board of Vykhod (Coming Out), St. Petersburg\u2019s gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights organization that was founded last year, believes the discussion was useful. \u201cUnfortunately \u2014 or fortunately, we saw the true colors of the contemporary political scene as it is,\u201d Sozayev said by phone on Thursday. \u201cOur politicians cannot speak normally about violations of the rights of the LGBT community. For them, it is all either very funny or very scabrous, and we saw more evidence of this yesterday. But the fact that it was articulated, that it entered the public space, the space of public youth politics is already an achievement, because it would not have been possible even 12 months ago. \u201cWe are starting to come out, so the reaction will naturally be negative and tough on the part of homophobes, but we should be prepared for that. We merely see confirmation of the necessity of our work. The Week Against Homophobia is dedicated to the memory of victims of political repression. \u201cThe year of 2009 has been declared a year for remembering gays and lesbians who were the victims of political repression, because this year it will be 75 years since consensual same-sex relations between men became criminally punishable under the Soviet Criminal Code,\u201d Sozayev said. Similar events have been held in the city in the past, but this year, importantly, it is part of Xenophobii.NET, or the No to Xenophobia campaign, which was launched on March 15 and continues through Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting and positive that in St. Petersburg it has become part of the coalition and is held with the support of other public organizations, and this is for the first time,\u201d Sozayev said. \u201cMany public organizations, both human rights and political, have supported this event.\u201d Although Vykhod takes part in demonstrations such as last year\u2019s anti-Nazi March Against Hatred, Sozayev described his organization as \u201cnon-political.\u201d \u201cThe March Against Hatred is not a political march, it\u2019s a citizens\u2019 march, [but] we don\u2019t take part in and are not planning to take part in political events, because people who belong to the LGBT community have diverse political views, so we cannot maintain a specific political view. \u201cOur task is not to confront the authorities, but to help them to fulfill the obligations they took on for themselves.\u201d Last year, however, the gay community saw a clampdown by the St. Petersburg authorities. In October, Side by Side, St. Petersburg\u2019s first lesbian and gay film festival, had to take place in private after fire inspectors suddenly shut down the two venues due to host the event. Those venues had in turn been hurriedly booked after Pik Cinema mysteriously withdrew its support for the festival. Earlier in the year, gay clubs Central Station and Bunker were subject to police raids. \u201cI think that despite everything, we can cooperate with the authorities,\u201d Sozayev said. \u201cThe fact that some events are being held now and that the authorities are not putting any pressure on these events is also indicative of that, as well as the fact that our organization was officially registered with no problems [in January]. \u201cWe can\u2019t see what is on the authorities\u2019 mind, but some process is underway.\u201d",

  "text": "Freemason Bogdanov Joins Sochi Mayor Race. Former presidential candidate Andrei Bogdanov on Wednesday became the latest entry into the crowded Sochi mayoral election, saying the Black Sea resort could become \u201cthe Nice of Russia.\u201d Bogdanov, 39, is the former head of the now-defunct Democratic Party of Russia, which was widely seen as a Kremlin-controlled project to draw votes away from actual opposition candidates and give voters a tame liberal option. \u201cSochi should become the Nice of Russia, where the majority can earn a living through small businesses,\u201d Bogdanov told The Moscow Times on Wednesday after submitting his registration papers to the Sochi elections commission. The mayoral election in Sochi, which is slated to host the 2014 Winter Olympics, has become one of the year\u2019s most intriguing political events. Several high-profile candidates, including opposition politician Boris Nemtsov and businessman Alexander Lebedev, have already announced that they would run for the post. Bogdanov\u2019s bid brings to the election one of the country\u2019s most curious political actors. Though virtually unknown nationally, Bogdanov was the only independent candidate who managed to get on the ballot of the 2008 presidential election by collecting 2 million signatures to support his campaign. Critics call Bogdanov a Kremlin stooge and say his inclusion on the presidential ballot was merely a Kremlin move to have a token liberal in the election, which Dmitry Medvedev won by a landslide. Promising to make Russia an EU member, Bogdanov captured a measly 1.3 percent of the vote. Bogdanov, who also who heads up the country\u2019s largest Masonic lodge, told The Moscow Times by telephone Wednesday that he would again run as an independent in the Sochi election. Twenty-two candidates had applied to get on the ballot as of Wednesday, Interfax reported. The deadline to register for the April 26 election is Thursday. State Duma Deputy Andrei Lugovoi, who faces murder charges in Britain in connection with the 2006 poisoning death of Alexander Litvinenko in London, had expressed interest in running but announced this week that he would not enter the race. The United Russia candidate, acting Sochi Mayor Anatoly Pakhomov, is seen as a favorite in the election.",

  "text": "Russian-American Crew Blasts Off to Space Station. BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan \u2014 A Soyuz capsule carrying a Russian-American crew and U.S billionaire space tourist Charles Simonyi blasted off for the international space station Thursday. The Russian rocket lifted off on schedule from the Baikonur cosmodrome facility in a roar of fire and soared into the cold, overcast skies over northern Kazakhstan\u2019s barren steppes. Simonyi, a software designer paying $35 million for his second trip on the Soyuz, joined Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka and American astronaut Michael Barratt in the cramped capsule, where they will sit for nearly two days before hooking up with the station, orbiting some 350 kilometers above the Earth. Minutes after blast-off, TV cameras from inside the Soyuz showed Padalka and Barratt waving for the camera and giving the thumbs-up OK sign. At viewing stands a few hundred meters away, scores of officials, reporters and relatives watched the launch, including Simonyi\u2019s 28-year-old Swedish socialite wife Lisa Persdotter, who wept and clutched at the coat of a relative. \u201cI\u2019m very, very happy. It was very, very smooth,\u201d she said afterward. Also watching was Paul Allen, a co-founder of software giant Microsoft Corp., where Simonyi worked for many years. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic to see a launch, but when it\u2019s one of your friends, it\u2019s just something so special,\u201d he said. Asked if he would be interested in going to space sometime, Allen said he would consider it; not on the Russian capsules or U.S. shuttles, but on one of his own crafts. In 2004, Allen used his Microsoft fortunes to bankroll SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 became the first private, manned craft to reach space. While Barratt and Padalka will join the current station\u2019s permanent crew, Simonyi will return to Earth 13 days later \u2014 a trip that will make him the first two-time space tourist and, for the foreseeable future, the last.",

  "text": "Santa Clara murder still haunts family 15 years later. At first, the Christmas cards from their son's old boss arrived year after year at the Mauro home, always remembering the promising young engineer, gunned down in broad daylight at Applied Materials. Then, eventually, the cards stopped. So, too, did the calls from police. What hasn't stopped are the restless nights, lying awake, tormented with the same piercing questions about a murder that happened 15 years ago today. Who would have wanted Matthew D. Flores dead? Why would anyone want to kill the handsome, charismatic husband and father \u2014 a decorated Army veteran who led a seemingly ordinary life? \"It's been 15 years, it is still an unsolved homicide and nothing has ever come about,\" said Mike Mauro, Flores' stepfather. \"We're still hoping someday, someone will call us and say, 'Here's what happened and here's the reason.' \" But the mystery surrounding the case still haunts them as they wait in frustration for Santa Clara police to find their son's shooter, a phantom-like killer who slipped away without a trace from the parking lot of Building 12 on March 24, 1994. But there was one potentially explosive piece of evidence caught on a grainy security videotape \u2014 a black and white Ford Explorer, seen circling the parking lot before the shooting, then leaving only seconds after Flores was shot. The driver has never been found. \"The most puzzling thing about this case is that it was so busy that morning, yet we didn't have as many witnesses as you would think there would be,'' said Capt. Stewart Cusimano, who's been at the department for 29 years. \"That's what was really lacking here.\" Flores, 26, had just left the Army where he had served as a lieutenant during Operation Desert Storm. He had moved his wife and 8-month-old daughter, Danielle, to Santa Clara for a job at Applied Materials where he was to train for a few months before transferring to the company's Dallas office. \"He had paid his dues and put himself through college,'' said his mother, Ellen Mauro, from her home in Rhode Island, where Flores grew up. \"This was his big chance and he never got to enjoy it.\" In the 15 years since Flores' death, Mauro hounded the FBI, congressional leaders and former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno for help in her son's case. She even sought out psychics. Nothing panned out. \"I spent more than five years going everywhere and anywhere to anyone who I thought could help,'' she said, \"and all I would get were doors slammed in my face or letters saying, 'We can't help you.' '' His widow, Denise, a nurse who lives in Massachusetts, never remarried and both she and Danielle always wonder why Flores' life was taken so brutally. \"We lived very ordinary lives,'' she said. \"There have been so many days and nights when I've thought of every possible scenario and nothing makes sense.\" Danielle knows her father only through videos and photographs, including one near the Golden Gate Bridge taken days before his death, where's he's holding her in his arms. Flores' case has appeared on \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" airing periodically over the years and occasionally generating new leads. \"We've probably spent more time on this case than any other case that I can recall,\" Cusimano said. More recently, Santa Clara police had consultants look at the case, submitted new evidence to the lab and reviewed the surveillance tape. Detectives also took a new look at his military connections, exploring his relationships and assignments. Flores had no known enemies, so there's a question whether it could have been a case of mistaken identity. \"There are no facts that can substantiate a theory,\" Cusimano said. The family, however, remains frustrated with police. Cusimano said he understands. \"I don't blame them. I'm frustrated. This is one of those cases that I have always taken a personal interest in.\" At Applied Materials, the executives who knew Flores are gone. His old boss, Gary Robertson, who found him in the parking lot that day, no longer wants to talk about the case. And, since Flores had been at the tech company just days, not many knew him. Still, a reminder of him lingers at the company's sprawling campus. There, near the dull forbidding concrete Building 12 on Oakmead Village Drive, is a scarcely noticeable barren tree planted in Flores' honor. Next to it lies a tombstone-like granite monument ensconced in a cluster of rocks with a plaque. It says simply: Matthew D. Flores, 1967-1994. Murder victim Matthew Flores was killed in 1994 in the Applied Materials parking lot. The case is still unsolved. This is Flores' ID badge for Applied Materials. Courtesy of the Flores family. -- SLUG: coldcase PHOTO DATE: NA SCAN DATE: 3/20/2009 CREDIT: Courtesy of the Flores fa What made the Flores' case all the more baffling was that even though it happened just minutes after 8 a.m. as he arrived to work on his ninth day on the job, it appears that no one saw the shooting. Not the woman who heard the shot and turned to see his kneeling body, slumped next to the driver's door of his sedan. Nor the other drivers who entered the parking lot just before he was shot once in the back of the head at point-blank range. None of the security cameras captured the shooting, and there was no shell casing from a weapon or sign of a struggle. None of his belongings were taken.",

  "text": "Oakland officer shot by parolee is taken off life support. SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A fourth Oakland police officer who was shot by a 26-year-old man wanted on a parole violation has been taken off of life support, a hospital spokeswoman said Tuesday. Officer John Hege was taken off life support Monday night, said Andrea Breaux of Alameda County Medical Center. The 41-year-old Concord resident's family had kept him alive so his organs could be donated, in keeping with his wishes. Breaux said the process of harvesting Hege's organs started just after 8 p.m. Monday and was completed by 2 a.m. today. According to police, Hege and a partner, Sgt. Mark Dunakin, were gunned down when they pulled over the parolee on Saturday. A massive manhunt ensued and two more officers died when the city's SWAT team stormed an apartment where the suspected gunman, Lovelle Mixon, was hiding. Mixon was fatally shot. The two officers who were killed at the apartment were Sgt. Ervin Romans, 43, and Sgt. Daniel Sakai, 35. \"This is the biggest tragedy ever to hit our department,\" Oakland police Sgt. Mark Schmid said Monday. \"We're just numb and walking around like zombies. We feel each other's pain but we don't know how to explain it.\" Flowers piled up outside Oakland police headquarters and books brimmed with condolences. A vigil was planned for Tuesday evening at the corner near where the two motorcycle officers pulled over Mixon. DNA found at the scene of the rape was a probable match to Lovelle Mixon, Oakland police spokesman Jeff Thomason said Monday night. Investigators got that information Friday, the day before the routine traffic stop ended in gunfire. California prison records show that authorities had issued a warrant for Mixon's arrest after he failed to make a mandatory meeting with his parole officer on Feb. 19. The family said he had previously served six years in state prison for assault with a firearm during an armed robbery in San Francisco. More recently, he had served several months in prison last year. State Attorney General Jerry Brown said he will examine how Mixon, 26, was monitored following his release from prison in November. Mixon also was a suspect in a murder but was never charged, according to state prison officials. \"Mixon was certainly a character that needed more supervision,\" said Brown, the former mayor of Oakland. \"In Oakland, the highway patrol has an office there, sheriff and police. And all those agencies should have a list of the more dangerous, threatening parolees so they can keep a watch on them.\" Problems involving parolees from California's overcrowded prison system have long beset state officials who must monitor them, local officials who try to keep streets safe and federal authorities who enforce firearms and other laws. Mixon was one of 164 Oakland parolees in mid-March who had outstanding arrest warrants for parole violations, state prison records show. The city of 400,000 had more than 1,900 total parolees at the time, including nearly 300 who had been returned to custody or whose parole was about to be revoked. During traffic stops, police often check vehicle records to find whether the driver has outstanding warrants. But police have not disclosed how Saturday's shooting unfolded. Mixon's family members said he was upset that he was unable to find work, felt his parole officer was not helping him and feared he would be arrested for a parole violation. State prison officials said Mixon's parole officer was responsible for 70 parolees. A caseload of that size is nearly unmanageable, and also not unusual, said Lance Corcoran, spokesman for California's prison guard union, which includes parole officers. \"There is no control,\" Corcoran said. \"It's simply supervision, and supervision at distance.\" Associated Press writers Josh Dubow, Lisa Leff and Juliana Barbassa in San Francisco and Terry Collins in Oakland contributed to this report. This is an undated photo released by the Oakland Police Department of Oakland Police officer John Hege. A man wanted for violating his parole killed three police officers and gravely wounded Hege in two shootings Saturday, March 21, 2009. Hege was taken off life support Tuesday.

  "text": "Santa Clara Valley Water District calls for mandatory rationing. Silicon Valley's largest water supplier voted unanimously today to call for mandatory rationing, asking residents and businesses to cut back 15 percent this summer. Santa Clara Valley Water District directors voted 7-0 for the rationing measure after more than two hours of discussion. The move comes after three consecutive dry years. Directors indicated they will spend $2 million on an outreach campaign encouraging people to conserve. The district \u2014 which provides drinking water for 1.8 million people in Santa Clara County from Los Altos to Gilroy \u2014 has no enforcement powers because it is a wholesale provider of water. But the board can ask the district's 13 retail suppliers, such as the San Jose Water Company and the cities of Sunnyvale and Morgan Hill, to set up new pricing rules that charge customers a premium if they use more than a set amount of water. The district will also ask every city in Santa Clara County to approve an ordinance that would ban lawn watering during daytime hours, require nozzles on garden hoses and limit watering to odd-even days, with fines for violators. In late May, the city of San Jose will vote on its ordinance, which would take effect in June. City officials said today they were unsure if that would include fines. reduced pumping for the portion of the delta it controls to 20 percent of contracted amounts, and federal officials, who control another portion, have reduced it to 50 percent. Despite February rains, large reservoirs that feed the delta are only half full from two dry years.",

  "text": "Santa Clara County sex assault conviction overturned. A state appeals court has reversed a Santa Clara County sexual assault conviction, finding the defendant received a \"grossly unfair trial'' because a trial judge allowed the prosecutor to improperly rely on a separate indecent exposure allegation to persuade the jury to return a guilty verdict. In a ruling last week, a divided panel of the San Jose-based 6th District Court of Appeal overturned Cameron Lee Earle's conviction for assaulting a woman in a local parking lot in December 2004. The appeals court concluded that Earle's trial was tainted because Superior Court Judge Rene Navarro allowed the jury to consider a separate, unrelated misdemeanor indecent exposure charge, which was emphasized heavily by the prosecutor. The 6th District found that the evidence against Earle was weak and circumstantial in the more serious sexual assault case, and that trying the two allegations at the same time allowed prosecutors to exploit the indecent exposure evidence \"through spurious legal theories'' to convict Earle. The appellate panel ruled that Earle was entitled to separate trials on the two distinct charges. Justice Nathan Mihara dissented, saying trying the two charges together did not deprive Earle of a fair trial and did not prejudice the outcome. Earle is currently serving his sentence of five years and eight months in prison for his convictions.",

  "text": "Risks pay off for Saratoga native who's film 'Haunting in Connecticut' is about to be released. Andrew Trapani is a gambling man. Rising from a West Valley College student to video game tester to Hollywood producer is a testament to Trapani's willingness to work hard and take risks. Those risks have paid off as Trapani's first major-release feature film, \"The Haunting in Connecticut,\" will open in theaters on March 27. But Trapani's story really begins about 20 years ago. Trapani rose quickly through the ranks in his five years with the company, going from game tester to designer and then ultimately to producer. The Saratoga native oversaw the development of some of the first Sony Playstation games, which was a transitioning period for video game developers as games went from cartridges to a CD format, which gave video games richer and more robust play, Trapani said. But one of the moments that steered the course of his career came in the late 1990s, when he produced a 30-minute movie-esque narrative for the video game, Solar Eclipse. Trapani and his crew spent three days shooting footage in Los Angeles. One day he and a peer were discussing what they would do if they won the lottery. Trapani said he would produce movies. After some thought, Trapani said he realized that he didn't have to win the lottery. So in March 1998 he resigned from his position and decided not long after to move to Los Angeles. \"I didn't have it all figured out, but I knew I wanted to do movies,\" he said. \"I always knew I wanted to do something that didn't require that I wear a suit every day.\" Within his first year in Los Angeles Trapani produced the independent film, \"True Rights,\" about a camera crew that chases down news events in hopes of locking up a movie deal. The movie was shot in 18 days on 35-millimeter film in what Trapani calls a \"run and gun, guerilla-style\" format. While in post-production on \"True Rights,\" Trapani received a call from someone he had worked with on the film, asking if he would be interested in producing commercials. Trapani said yes and spent a few months on commercial production. In 2000 Trapani founded Integrated Films, a production and management company, which has produced the movies Borderland, Tamara and the remake of Amityville Horror. But in a few days Trapani's latest film, \"The Haunting in Connecticut,\" will hit theaters across the nation, which will undoubtedly have much more exposure to a wider audience than any of his previous films. \"I'm really proud of it. I'm proud of everyone who contributed to it,\" he said. \"The Haunting\" is based on the true story of the Snedeker family, who moved into a Connecticut home back in the 1980s that had once been a mortuary. The story goes that the family was looking for an affordable place to live where their son, who was undergoing cancer treatment, could be closer to the hospital where he was receiving treatment. The family, not knowing the dark history of the home, began having unexplained things happen in their house. The movie stars Academy Award-nominated actress Virginia Madsen (\"Sideways\"). The idea to do this movie came to Trapani after he watched a 2003 documentary on the family on the Discovery Channel. He thought the story would make a great movie and contacted the family, eventually receiving the rights to make a feature film. Two years later Trapani was able to sell the movie to Gold Circle Films, an independent film production company, and the writers were able to begin putting together the script. \"At that point we were finally on our way to getting the movie made,\" Trapani said. The producer said that he knows that no matter how well this movie does, the mass audience will most likely never know who he is. And he says he is just fine with that. \"I didn't come to Los Angeles to be an actor,\" he said. \"Fame is not of interest to me.\" Instead, Trapani said he's much more interested in putting out quality films and having the respect of his peers. That's much more valuable to him, he says, and more in line with what he cares about. \"At the end of the day it's up to the producer to protect the integrity of the movie,\" he said. \"I just love movies. I understand them in a way that is a byproduct of what I was predisposed to do.\" Just as he's done with his career, Trapani said he follows his gut when it comes to making a movie. If it feels right, go for it; if not, something needs to change. He'll need his instincts to help him as he and his business partner, Brian Gilbert, move forward with other projects in their new production and management venture. Gilbert is the former production president of Stan Winston Studio, which was involved in such films as Jurassic Park, Alien and Iron Man, Trapani said. Trapani and Gilbert have already signed on for two Scooby Doo film sequels and a movie starring Nicholas Cage that will start filming early next year. The two are also involved in representing screenwriters and directors and helping them focus on their long-term career goals. Trapani admits that life can be a little overwhelming at times, especially since he can be working on 60 different projects at various stages of development. But he said he feeds off of it and is enthralled with film production. When things do get a little crazy on set, Trapani says that he thinks about Geoffrey Rush's character from \"Shakespeare in Love.\" Rush's character, Philip Henslowe, is asked how the play will be ready with so much madness going on around them. Rush replies, \"It's a mystery.\" He grew up in Saratoga, but it's Hollywood that Andy Trapani now calls home. Trapani is a movie producer, and his first major feature film,`The Haunting in Connecticut,' will hit the theaters on March 27.",

  "text": "Investors flock to buy California bonds. SACRAMENTO \u2014 Investors this week flocked to California's first major bond sale in nine months, a development that will soon free up billions of dollars for public works projects put on hold because of the state's budget mess. State Treasurer Bill Lockyer announced that the state sold $6.54 billion in general obligation bonds on Monday and Tuesday, easily surpassing a $4 billion target he had set going into the sale. His office said late Tuesday it was the largest long-term general obligation bond sale \"ever in the country.\" The tax-exempt bonds carry yields ranging from 3.2 to 6.1 percent, depending on when they mature (from 2013 to 2038). \"This is a great result for California's workers, businesses and economy,\" Lockyer said in a statement. California has been shut out of the debt market because of its budget mess and the tight national credit market. And without the ability to sell bonds, the state was forced to freeze about $2.6 billion in financing since December for more than 5,000 infrastructure projects. With the deficit addressed for the time being with the plan signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last month, officials said recently that they expect soon to unfreeze $500 million in infrastructure funds that had been put on hold. But after this week's sale, they are expected to unlock an additional $2.6 billion for public works projects, although it could take several weeks to disburse the money. Roxanne Miller, a lobbyist for the city of San Jose, said that can't happen soon enough. Dozens of projects in San Jose are awaiting financing from the state's so-called Pooled Money Investment Account, including a $15 million traffic light synchronization project; $5.5 million for improvements to public trails; and several million dollars for affordable housing projects. With the state's finances in shambles, San Jose has had to front the money to keep many of those projects going, Miller said. But that can continue only for so long. \"We're getting to the point where everyone needs some indication, some certainty that the money will be there,\" she said. Miller added that a $10 million project to upgrade Highway 101 at Tully Road, scheduled to begin construction within months, will be put on hold if state infrastructure funds aren't unleashed soon. She called the successful bond sale \"a big deal for all of us.\" The state's move to freeze infrastructure funds was at odds not only with Schwarzenegger's stated priorities but with the federal stimulus package approved last month. Last week, the governor held a news conference to tout 57 projects in line to receive the first injection of federal stimulus dollars for transportation, totaling $626 million. Santa Clara County projects on that list include $33 million for a rehab of Highway 280 from the Cypress Avenue pedestrian over-crossing to Tantau Avenue, and maintenance of a stretch of Highway 35 near Los Gatos.",

  "text": "Mass. legislators put off debate on gas tax hike. \"We've been pretty clear. We need to get to the reform-related issues before we do anything else,\" said Rep. Joseph F. Wagner, D-Chicopee, the co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Transportation. \"The public wants to see what we are going to do to fix a system that is broken.\" The announcement came as the five-member board of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority is scheduled to meet 3 p.m. on Monday at Ludlow Town Hall. Although the authority on Monday is expected to vote to delay a toll increase in or near Boston, Wagner said he will ask board members to consider restoring tolls for passenger vehicles between Exits 1 in West Stockbridge and Exit 6 near Springfield as a way to generate money for maintenance of the western end of the turnpike. He said Monday's meeting would be an appropriate time and place for the board to weigh bringing back those tolls as well as a toll in West Newton that also was taken down in 1996, but as of Thursday, the issue was not on the board's agenda for Monday. The Boston toll increase was scheduled to take effect in two stages starting on March 29. The governor, Senate President Therese Murray, D-Plymouth, and House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, D-Winthrop, and turnpike officials have agreed to use turnpike reserve money to ward off the March 29 toll increase while they negotiate a more comprehensive answer for the state's transportation financing shortfall. The authority had approved the toll increases last month, turning up the heat on legislators to act on a bill to boost the gas tax as a way to prevent the toll hikes. Instead, Thursday's agreement gives legislators some more time to weigh Patrick's bill for a 19-cent increase in the state's 23.5-cent gas tax. Wagner said there is no support in the Legislature for the 19-cent increase Patrick proposed in his transportation bill submitted last month. Wagner said he couldn't say how much of an increase in the gas tax that legislators might support. \"I get the clear sense that 10 cents may be too much,\" Wagner said. The western portion of the turnpike is a separate financial operation from the road east of Route 128. If tolls were reinstated between Exits 1 and 6, Wagner said, it would provide more money for maintaining the western end of the turnpike. \"The road is in a terrible state of disrepair,\" Wagner said. \"It's clear the turnpike doesn't have the revenues to maintain that road.\" Rep. Donald F. Humason, R-Westfield, said he would support restoring tolls between Exits 1 and 6 if the revenues are used to improve the western part of the turnpike. Humason said he is concerned, however, with the plan by legislative leaders to approve a reform bill next week while delaying a possible tax increase until sometime before July 1. Humason said there would not be enough time for the reforms to kick in and save some money. \"Put the reforms in place,\" Humason said. \"Let them stand for a year. Let them stand for six months. Give them a chance to work.\" The authority has lost $12 million a year since it eliminated tolls for passenger vehicles between Exits 1 in West Stockbridge near the New York border and Exit 6 at Interstate 291 in Chicopee in 1996, according to Mary Z. Connaughton, of Framingham, a turnpike board member. Connaughton said she supports reinstating tolls for passenger vehicles in Western Massachusetts to generate money for maintenance for that section of the turnpike. She also wants to reinstate tolls on that section of the road because tolls are set to increase in Boston and the turnpike extension in Boston. Connaughton said bringing back tolls between Exits 1 and 6 would also help assure that the turnpike from Route 128 westward becomes free of tolls in eight years. Under current authority plans, bonds are to be paid off in 2017 on the 123-mile western portion from the New York border to Route 128. Under state law, the tolls are supposed to be removed when construction debt is paid. Connaughton said she is concerned that the commissioner of the state Highway Department could refuse to accept the western end of the turnpike as a state road if it is in poor condition in 2017. Connaughton wants the turnpike authority on Monday to consider restoring tolls for passenger vehicles between Exit 1 and Exit 6. The western end of the turnpike is currently operating at a deficit of about $15 million a year if the authority spends what it should on bridge repairs, paving and other capital projects, according to a report by the state Transportation Finance Commission. The turnpike board's meeting on Monday will center around an expected vote to delay a big toll increase scheduled to take place in Boston and on the turnpike extension east of Route 128. The first stage of the toll increase will boost tolls from $1.25 to $1.50 at the Allston and Weston booths and from $3.50 to $5.50 at the Boston Harbor tunnels. A second toll increase, due to take effect July 1, will raise the tolls at Allston and Weston to $2 and the tunnel tolls to $7. Board members approved those toll increases to help pay off $2.2 billion in debt left from the $14.8 billion Big Dig, maintenance and capital improvements.",

The city got $478,000 from the MassDevelopment Cultural Fund and provided matching funds from unspent bond money, one Springfield official said. The window work is estimated at $750,000 and the lighting system at $250,000. \"The windows are not energy efficient,\" said Patrick J. Sullivan, city director of parks, buildings and recreation management. \"This project will end up saving money as well as making the building more comfortable for the patrons.\" The new lighting control system will enhance performances, Sullivan said. \"It is important to keep up with repairs of this building because it is really a strong component of economic development and supporting the arts in the city,\" he said. In 2004, Symphony Hall benefited from a $850,000 renovation project through a private fund-raising effort. Renovations included padding and upholstery on more than 2,600 seats, interior painting, a new rest room for women, and installation of a stage curtain, draperies and carpeting. Cynthia J. Anzalotti, president of Springfield Performing Arts Development Corp., which manages Symphony Hall and CityStage, said she is pleased that the work will now move forward. \"It is a city building and it's part of the community,\" she said. \"Every event we have there is for our community, and benefits our patrons, restaurants, bars, and everything downtown.\" She is optimistic that work will be completed by early September. The windows are leaky, let in cold and hot air, and adversely affect sound, she said, and the new lighting controls \"will make a vast improvement.\" Chad LaBumbard, technical director, said the current \"extremely antiquated\" lighting control system was installed 30 years ago. The new system is \"industry standard\" and will be easier to maintain and repair, he said. SPRINGFIELD - The city is seeking bids for two renovation projects at Symphony Hall with a total cost estimated at $1 million - to refurbish windows, and to replace a lighting control system installed 30 years ago. Bids will be opened on Thursday for a new \"theatrical dimming and controls\" system, and on April 10 for window renovations that include replacement of perimeter caulk, painting and repairs. The 97-year-old building at Court Square, is city-owned.",

  "text": "Springfield City Council OKs renewal plan designation for Chapman Valve plant site. Still, officials and residents said, the council's 9-0 vote is a welcome sign toward getting the former Chapman Valve site to thrive again. \"We've waited a very long time for this. We've looking forward to it being developed,\" said Susan M. Craven Soto, president of the Indian Orchard Citizens Council. Chapman Valve at Goodwin and Pinevale streets once was the world's largest manufacturers of all kinds of valves, including fire hydrants, and employed nearly 3,500 people. The plant moved here from Boston in 1874. Crane Co., of Chicago, bought the company in 1959 and closed it in 1988. The plant milled uranium at Chapman Valve in the late 1940s in a nuclear power project for the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y. The U.S. Navy cleaned the site and recent city tests have shown it to be radiation-free, officials have said. But the site also is likely to contain oils, asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyl, commonly known as PCB's, man-made organic chemicals banned in 1979, officials have said. Another problem is the discovery in the past few years of a series of underground tunnels and pits, prompting questions about the strength of the foundation. The Chapman Valve plant has been demolished. The city owns two parcels, or nearly 14 acres. The remaining 39 acres are controlled by private owners, including Crane Co., which still owns about half an acre, said Christopher J. Moskal, senior project manager with the city Office of Planning and Economic Development. The urban renewal designation lets the city begin negotiating with the 39 acres' owners, Brian M. Connors, acting city chief development officer, said before the meeting. The designation must be approved by the state Department of Housing and Community Development. Officials see that as likely in light of Gov. Deval L. Patrick in August announcing a program to speed the cleanup of former industrial sites in the state, including the Chapman Valve property.",

  "text": "Chicopee residents discuss conservation land purchase. Several residents in the area had protested land owner Yves Demers' plans to build single-family homes on the land. He is now negotiating to sell 30.23 acres to the city for conservation purposes while keeping 1.5 acres at the end of Nelson Street to build two single-family homes. The land has been appraised at $450,000, while he has signed an \"offer to sell real estate\" agreement with the city for $500,000. In December, the council granted Demers a zone change from industrial to Residential A on 31.7 acres there to build single family houses. Bissonnette told residents the city doesn't want to build a park on the conservation land. Some residents are concerned about increased traffic in the neighborhood if the land becomes a recreational area. \"This is not going to be a park. The idea is to keep it in its most natural setting,\" Bissonnette said. The City Council's Recreation Committee will hold a public hearing on the grant application on Wednesday at 6:30 p.m. in Council Chambers in City Hall. The mayor and city department heads also gave briefings on the Front Street reconstruction project, that has just begun, along with the upcoming Center Street reconstruction project, the CVS under construction at Hampden and Center streets, and construction of the bike path-canal park from Front Street near City Hall to Grape Street that should begin next month.",

The victim, who was not identified, sustained a gunshot wound to the back and one in the leg in an early morning incident at Orange and White streets, said Capt. Eugene C. Dexheimer. Officers were dispatched to the intersection at 12:20 a.m. after receiving word of the shooting which is believed to have occurred about midnight. The victim told authorities a man approached him, attempted to rob him and shot him in the leg with a revolver. As he attempted to run away, he was shot a second time in the back. \"He somehow managed to get into a vehicle and drive himself to Mercy Medical Center,\" said Dexheimer. His condition is not considered life-threatening. The suspect is described as a black male, 180 pounds, bald andwearing a white shirt and jeans. Dexheimer said officers scoured the scene but were unable to locate the gun and there were no witnesses.",

  "text": "Western Mass. stargazers to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. Meg Thacher, who teaches astronomy at Smith College in Northampton and lives in West Springfield with her husband and two children, is organizing her hometown's star party. It will be held Friday from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. at Mittineague Park. Everyone is invited to come, and anyone with a telescope should bring it along. April presents some interesting celestial scenes. \"Saturn looks really lovely at this time of year,\" Thacher said. Its rings are edge on, enabling sky-gazers to view the brightest of Saturn's many moons. On Friday, the moon is in its first quarter, a perfect time to observe the lunar landscape. \"You can really see the craters,\" she said. Just going outside and looking at the moon with the naked eye is one thing. It can be beautiful, and some details are evident. But add a telescope, and it's a whole new experience. \"The level of detail is amazing,\" Thacher said. If peering at the moon seems too ordinary, what about a nebula? The Orion Nebula is one of the closest star formation regions. Because it is so close to earth, it is a great location to see how stars are born and progress. \"It's several times the size of our own solar system,\" Thacher said. \"These are stars formed by dust and gas. The light is so strong that it can push away the dust,\" she said. Through the telescope, these formations are remarkable to view, she said. Other events in the region are scheduled for 100 Hours of Astronomy. The Springfield Science Museum will host \"Stars Over Springfield\" on Friday at 7:30 p.m. Amateur astronomer Michael Kozicki will speak on \"Saturn's Disappearing Rings.\" Members of the Springfield Stars Club will be on hand, and participants may gaze at the stars in the museum observatory and through telescopes on the Quadrangle green. The cost is $3 for adults and $2 for children. Amherst College's Wilder Observatory open house at 9 p.m. on Saturday will give people a chance to use the 6-ton Clark Refractor as well as smaller telescopes set up by the Amherst Area Amateur Astronomy Association. The association also will offer a free program, Safe Solar Observing on Saturday from 1 to 2:30 p.m. at the Amherst Common and from 3 to 4:30 p.m. at A2Z Science and Learning Center in Northampton. Stargazing at the Sofinowski will take place sunset to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday at the Sofinowski Land Preserve in Southwick. Stargazers throughout Western Massachusetts will be joining others across the planet this week in celebrating Galileo. The \"100 Hours of Astronomy\" program is part of an international celebration of the 400th anniversary of Galileo's work. From Thursday through Sunday, astronomers, amateur astronomers and anyone interested in stars and planets will gather to point telescopes skyward. The goal is to get as many people throughout the world to look through a telescope as Galileo did. Advancements by Galileo Galilei, born in Italy around 1564, include making significant improvements to the telescope and astronomical observation, discovering moons of Jupiter, and defending Copernicus's theory that the Earth revolved around the sun, in contrast to the teachings of the Roman Catholic church. He died under house arrest ordered by the Roman Inquisition.",

He has taught, been a school librarian, and assistant superintendent at the former Belchertown State School. \"I want to bring all that experience\" to the committee, he said. Serving on those financial committees gave him an insight into the financial workings of the town budget and he believes that the overriding issue is the budget. Rivkin is chairman of the economics department at Amherst College. He specializes in the economics of education. Rivkin, along with current School Committee member Catherine A. Sanderson, co-founded the Amherst Committee for Excellence in 2007 in an attempt to ensure academic excellence for all children. As a committee member he wants to ensure that all students are intellectually engaged. And he also wants \"to bring a sense of open debate and discussion (at School Committee meetings) to focus on data and evidence . . . and most of all to focus on the children.\" Rhodes Tuesday night credited his committee for helping him win the seat. \"I'm ready,\" he said. \"I'm so ready.\" For Jones Library Board of Trustees Carol J. Gray and Sarah McKee won the two seats beating John M. McDonald III, and Lucy L. McMurrer. Incumbents Merrylees Turner and Ann H. Grose did not seek re-election. John W. Coull, former Chamber of Commerce executive director, won two positions, retaining his position as elector of the Oliver Smith Will, beating out David F. Farnham who had held the seat for a number of years. Coull also beat out Robert B. Kusner for Amherst Redevelopment Authority. Looks like about a 10% turnout in overly enlightened Amherst. But five months ago in the Presidential election, the turnout was close to 80% AMHERST - Irvin E. Rhodes was the big winner in the School Committee race in Tuesday's Annual Town Election, with Steven G. Rivkin finishing second in a three-way race for two seats. Megan D.

  "text": "Local health care providers banding together to help poor, uninsured. In the years that area health care leaders have struggled with how to care for the uninsured -- while limiting unnecessary use of hospital emergency rooms -- the problems have only gotten worse. The 2008 economic downturn rendered many jobless, without insurance and without the extra cash for medical care. Without coverage for routine doctor visits, the uninsured often wait to seek preventive care and medical treatment until they're very sick, requiring costlier care in ERs. Others use ERs as their source for primary care but can't pay the bill. Hospitals make up that uncompensated care in other areas by charging more or eliminating some services. Here's a local snapshot. - Springfield hospital emergency room visits by uninsured Greene County residents grew from 17,709 visits in 2003 to 33,760 visits in 2007, the latest compiled data available. - The most common reasons for those ER visits by the uninsured were dental pain, dental/respiratory complaints, respiratory/lumbar, throat problems, alcohol/neck sprain/respiratory, and ear complaints. - The Kitchen Clinic saw 2,000 patients in 2008, or 8,000 patient visits, and turns away hundreds of people every month for lack of providers. It gave more than 47,000 free prescriptions, up from 42,000 the year before. - CoxHealth system provided $33.5 million in bad debt and charity care in fiscal year 2003, $64.3 million in 2006, and by 2007 it increased to $93.6 million. In 2008 it rose by another 13 percent, to $105.9 million. (Calculation for charity and bad debt is based on write-offs from patient charges.) The combined emergency department and urgent care visits for Cox North, South and Walnut Lawn rose from 145,000 in fiscal year 2007 to 151,000 in fiscal year 2008. The Cox ERs, alone, saw 104,000 patients in 2008. -St. John's Health System write-offs for bad debts and charity combined was $93.4 million in fiscal year 2006, $117.6 million in fiscal year 2007, and totaled $144.1 million in fiscal year 2008. (This increase is due to an increase in the number of uninsured patients and an increase in the number of insured patients who have not met the patient portion of their co-payments and deductibles.) One out of every five patients who visit the ER does not carry insurance. St. John's ER visits totaled 87,600 in fiscal year 2008, representing a 3.6 percent increase over the fiscal year 2007 ER visits of 84,500. Source: Springfield hospitals, Springfield-Greene County Health Department \"We all provide a significant amount of coverage for the indigent ...\" said Kim Day, president and CEO of St. John's Health System and a commission member. \" ... The economic times, combined with the fact that funding to safety-net providers is drying up, has frankly caused us to work harder, together.\" \"The commission's public-private partnership with the community is not a substitute for state or national reform,\" Day said, \"but we hope our efforts will increase access to health care services for vulnerable people, improving health outcomes in an unhealthy state and region, and reduce costs in the long run.\" It's patterned after the successful St. Louis Regional Health Commission, recognized nationally for helping coordinate existing services and money to boost primary care and dental visits among the city's working poor. It's one of about 10 U.S. city initiatives having success increasing access, reducing chronic health problems and cutting their hospitals' charitable care load, Bradshaw said. A board is spearheading the commission, including Day, Edwards, Gipson and Miller, Brian Fogle with The Kitchen Inc., John Lilly with the Greene County Medical Society, and Paul Taylor, CEO of Ozarks Community Hospital (formerly Doctors Hospital of Springfield). Others will be added from government, business and the community. In St. Louis, a financially troubled group of primary care clinics consolidated with a Jordan Valley-style community health center. The once-strapped clinics became eligible for federal funding, patients had access to more federal services like disease management, and the money saved was used to hire more health care providers, Fruend said.",

(Donna Baxter / for the News-Leader) Logan Elementary was formed in 1952 when eight eastern Greene County rural districts consolidated. High school students had a choice -- Rogersville or Springfield. Two years later, seven rural Christian and Webster County districts consolidated into Rogersville. In 1965, Rogersville voted to annex to Logan. A new high school was built in southeast Greene County. All grade 7 and 8 students -- who up to that time had attended the two elementary buildings -- were moved into the old high school in Rogersville. The elementaries remained separate until 1983 when the district was reorganized. K-5 students attended Logan and grade 6-8 students went to Rogersville. After several subsequent reorganizations, Logan-Rogersville has five campuses (including the Logan building) with a population of nearly 2,300.",

  "text": "Family, friends mourn four children killed in fire. ST. PARIS \u2014 Scott Randall threw up and cried when he saw the mobile home ravaged by a fire that killed four children. \"The whole house was gone, especially the living room,\" he said. \"It looked like an explosion blew out the wall.\" Nathan Skaggs, 2; Patrick Snelling, 8; Breonna Snelling, 10; and Cassandra Karg, 10, died in a fire at 2:46 a.m. Saturday, March 21, at 11690 U.S. 36, Lot No. 15, in the St. Paris Court West mobile home park, just west of St. Paris, according to the Champaign County Sheriff's Office. Phillip Skaggs Jr., 33; Christina Gregg, 33; and Natalia Skaggs, 8-months, escaped. They were treated at Mercy Memorial Hospital in Urbana and released, according to a sheriff's office news release. The relationship between the children and the adults was not described, although Randall said Karg lived down the street and was visiting for the night. Randall lives at Lot No. 5 and has known the family for about six years. The family moved into the mobile home a few months ago and the children are good friends with Randall's son. \"I still don't know how to break it to my son,\" Randall said. Brandyberry stopped by their home Friday night, ate some cookies and talked with them. They were supposed to meet up again this morning at Kiser Lake to fish. Breonna Snelling did well in school and Patrick Snelling loved sports, he said. \"They are good kids ... They are the cutest little things,\" he said. Brandyberry visited Gregg at Mercy Memorial Hospital on Saturday morning. \"Those kids were her life. They would go without for their kids ... She is so scared she can't even hold her own little baby,\" he said. The mobile home had electrical problems, shocking people who touched parts of it, Randall said. The cause of the fire remains undetermined, said Shane Cartmill, public information officer for the Division of the State Fire Marshal. An electrical engineer will examine the mobile home for additional testing on Monday, Cartmill said. \"We have not ruled out electrical as a possible cause,\" he said. Tabitha Roderick, 15, was sleeping across the street at her grandmother's home at Lot No. 51 when the fire started. \"My grandmother came in and woke me up,\" she said. \"I came out and all I could really see was smoke and flames and the fire trucks. It looked like it was really bad.\" She had played with the children a few hours before the fire. The boys played football, and Roderick and Breonna Snelling made rhymes. Tammy Danner lives at Lot No. 7 and found out about the fire from a phone call at 4 a.m. She often saw the children riding their bikes or playing outside while waiting for the school bus in the morning. \"It's awful, this is terrible,\" Danner said. \"I can't even imagine it being one of my boyfriend's kids ... It could have been any one of these trailers.\"",

Springfield, Ohio \u2014 Police received a report that two teenage boys, a 17-year-old and an18-year-old, were robbed at gunpoint about 10 p.m. on Saturday, March 28. According to the police report, the teens said they were walking near the intersection of Fair Street and South Lowry Avenue when a man approached them. After initially asking them for change, the man reportedly said, \"Give me everything you got!\" then struck the 17-year-old across the face. The teen who said he was struck told police he realized the man had hit him with a gun, so he ran. The man with the gun reportedly then demanded the 18-year-old place his wallet on the ground. When he did so, the robber picked up the wallet, which contained $15, and fled northbound on South Lowry Avenue, according to the police report. The report noted that the teen who said he was struck had visible swelling on the left side of his face.",

  "text": "Ohioans slow to receive stimulus money. Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. Washington \u2014 By most measures, the $787 billion economic stimulus bill that President Barack Obama signed into law in February appears to be positively flying into the hands of state and local governments. Each week, the administration announces new formulas and new releases of funds, followed by a flurry of press releases from congressional offices touting the newest stimulus dollars in your neighborhood. According to those releases, the state has been approved for money for dilapidated National Guard armories, for hospitals to treat vulnerable populations and to spruce up crumbling highways. For a federal bureaucracy, it's as close to lightning-speed as it gets. But what the state actually has in hand is far less than what the press releases suggest. So far, the state has received just a fraction of the funds it's been notified that it will receive. The money it has received includes a little more than $388 million for Medicaid and a few million dollars for food for Ohio's aging population. \"It's out there,\" promises Dennis Evans of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, who said the state has been notified it will receive $298 million more in the months to come. \"It all depends on when the feds start laying it out there for everyone.\" In some cases, the grant process is all that's keeping the money from flowing. Communities getting grants on a formula basis have often been notified of their share of specific programs, but have to apply to get the funds. That's the case with the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grants. When doled out, those will give $61.6 million to the state. In the case of the federal highway transportation funds allocated this week, much of the money has to go through the state budget process before it can be spent. The state will pay for the projects and then be reimbursed by the federal government. \"Obviously our goal is getting this money invested in the economy as soon as possible,\" said Amanda Wurst, a spokeswoman for Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland. Described as a short-term shot of cash, the money will actually be sent out over the next two to three years, going through some 24 state agencies and, in some cases, going directly to counties and cities. The state announced earlier this month that it would receive $8.5 million for the Ohio National Guard \u2014 money to repair and update antiquated armories, including updating plumbing in Middletown. Mark Wayda, a spokesman for the Guard, said it expects to receive the wire transfer \"within the next couple of weeks.\" That they have to wait for a few more weeks, he said, is nothing \u2013 the Guard has been wanting to do these repairs for years. \"This money will give us the opportunity to fix a lot of things that have been broken that we have just not been able to get to,\" he said.",

  "text": "Alleged drug dealer's girlfriend will testify. Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. XENIA \u2014 The girlfriend of the alleged drug dealer who hanged himself in a Georgia jail last summer after being snared in a nationwide manhunt agreed Monday, March 30, to a plea deal that should spare her from prison. Chelsie D. Hornsburger, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of money laundering in Greene County Common Pleas Court. In exchange for her testimony against other members of a drug ring allegedly led by former Yellow Springs resident Umoja Iddi Bakari, prosecutors recommended she receive probation. The charges, both third degree felonies, carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. Hornsburger admitted to collecting drug debts on Bakari's behalf, two of which were $1,000 transactions with members of the Greene County Drug Task Force, according to court records. \"This is a good example of how someone who is naive can be sucked into a drug enterprise,\" said Suzanne Schmidt, first assistant prosecutor. Hornsburger also admitted to receiving drugs through the mail for Bakari and mailing drug payments to Arizona and California. Hornsburger met Bakari in 2007 and he told her he was a single dad. She later learned he was still married and operating a drug operation that brought marijuana and cocaine from Columbus to Yellow Springs for distribution, according to officials. Prosecutors also have indicted Bakari's wife, Bekelech M. Asefa, 26, of Canal Winchester, Ohio near Columbus, who faces 20 felony counts including racketeering and money laundering. She entered a not guilty plea to the charges earlier this month and is free without bond. Bakari fled the Columbus area last May before police raided several homes he owned there and arrested Hornsburger. Officers caught up with Bakari near Atlanta in June, but he hung himself with a T-shirt in jail shortly after his arrest. Police are still searching for Robert McDonald Jr., a former Greene County resident, who allegedly helped Bakari sell drugs. McDonald is wanted on 11 felony charges and also has lived in Atlanta and Florida, police said.",

NEW MIAMI \u2014 After a year of relative order, the village of New Miami is reeling again after a recently-resigned council member was arrested following an incident at the mayor's residence. Patricia Moore, 62, of the 100 block of Howman Avenue, was arrested at her home Wednesday afternoon, March, 25, and charged with criminal trespass and aggravated menacing, according to the Butler County Sheriff's Office. Moore allegedly tried to push her way into the home of New Miami Mayor Patti Hanes, according to police records. Hanes, 41, also of Howman Avenue, provided a statement to Butler County deputies indicating Moore was trying to gain entry to cause her physical harm. Moore was taken to the Butler County Jail where she was later released on her own recognizance. According to the narrative of her arrest, when deputies arrived at her home Moore held out her hands and said, \"I did it all and let it be noted when I get out I will find her and kick her ...\" Moore was among those who took the oath of office in January 2008 to fill several vacant positions on the village council. Moore said she resigned from her position a few weeks ago because of \"personal problems with the mayor.\" Moore said her family is intertwined with that of Hanes, but declined to comment further about the situation. Hanes also declined to comment about the incident. She said council is reviewing candidates to fill the seat vacated by Moore. Moore is scheduled to appear April 9 in Hamilton Municipal Court.",

  "text": "Incarcerated father misses daughter's funeral. Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. ST. PARIS \u2014 While hundreds of mourners paid their last respects to Cassie Karg and three other children who died in a recent trailer fire in St. Paris, Cassie's father mourned the loss in a prison cell in Orient, Ohio. Family members, prison officials and funeral home staff provided different stories about why Ricky Karg Jr. was unable to visit his daughter one last time before she was buried last weekend. Karg, who is serving a sentence on charges of receiving stolen property and failure to comply, was told of his daughter's death during a visitation period on March 23, about two days after the fire, said Jackie Rutherford, his sister and Cassie's aunt. While the family and the funeral home requested that he be allowed to visit his daughter, the request was eventually denied, she said. Instead, she said, Karg wrote a letter that was placed in his daughter's casket during a viewing Friday. \"He's not a hardened criminal and I think he should have had a chance to see his daughter,\" Rutherford said. The public viewing was scheduled to take place at Graham Middle School, but the correctional facility's policy prohibits inmates from visiting schools, said Angela Hill, a public information officer at the reception center. The facility also tried to schedule a private viewing, Hill said, but prison officials were not able to do so because the funeral home was unable to provide a specific time when the casket would be available. \"Because there were so many factors, we weren't able to make the arrangements, which had to be done in advance to allow (Ricky Karg) to get to a private viewing,\" Hill said. But Dave Vernon, director of Vernon's Funeral Home in Urbana, said he tried to work with the state and the family to coordinate a special visit, going as far as offering to transport the casket to Mechanicsburg, where it would be closer to the Correctional Reception Center in Orient where Ricky Karg. Jr. is incarcerated. \"It wasn't a matter of scheduling on our behalf,\" he said.",

  "text": "Longtime bus driver retires. Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. Springfield, Ohio \u2014 After 32 years driving the same bus route, Jerry Purdin knows the riders by name. \"Instead of riders, they felt more like a family, each and every one of them,\" he said. Purdin, 71, drove the Springfield City Area Transit Villa Road route for the last time on Thursday, March 26, joined by his family. He will retire effective today, march 31, after 35 years working for the Springfield Bus Co. In his time, Purdin has seen a lot of changes. The first buses he drove lacked wheelchair lifts, window defrosters and air conditioners. In summer, drivers kept the doors open to stay cool. He enjoyed his relationship with the riders and his colleagues. \"I got to talk to people every day and I like people,\" he said. \"Throughout the years, I met all kinds of people.\" Purdin once drove presidential candidate and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole around Ohio when he chartered a bus. \"Every time we stopped the bus, you had guys standing there from D.C. and they had these big guns,\" Purdin said. Rhonda Moore has worked with Purdin for 18 years. She didn't know if she would like him. On her first day driving alone, he yelled at her for a bad parking job. \"But he's a big softy, he's been fun,\" she said. \"He's like a big kid.\" Purdin likes to go all out and dress up for holidays, said Michelle Taber, SCAT operations manager. \"He was always on time, always here and always had a smile on his face,\" she said. He intends to travel to Hawaii and drive to Florida. \"I love driving,\" Purdin said. \"That's a bus driver's holiday \u2014 to drive.\"",

  "text": "Finalist Sommers tackles Springfield's finances, future. Megan Gildow brings you the latest from the offices, halls and classrooms of local schools. Springfield, Ohio \u2014 Butler Tech has been able to maintain high student achievement with low per-pupil costs by marketing to make sure seats were filled and eliminating spending that did not improve student achievement, CEO Bob Sommers told Springfield residents Monday, March 31. Sommers was the first of three finalists for the next city schools' superintendent to spend a day meeting staff, business leaders and the community as the final round of interviews for the position. He has been with Butler Technology and Career Development Schools since 2001 and by clearly defining and communicating goals, the school has reached new levels of success, he told the audience at Monday's open forum at Springfield High School. \"It's a focused attention to detail,\" he said. \"It's making sure that faculty and staff are given the opportunity to think and make decisions for student achievement.\" Questions at the forum focused on fiscal accountability as well as how Sommers, who has been superintendent of only Butler Tech, a joint vocational district, would handle new challenges like early childhood and elementary education at Springfield . Sommers said that he saw two major problems for Springfield: a need to improve student achievement and regain \"marketshare,\" or students who are going to charter, voucher and open enrollment options. \"There is no reason that Springfield City Schools cannot only regain its marketshare, but also become the premier place where you turn to go to school,\" he said. Sommers said that he would focus on putting systems in place that allowed staff to make the best decisions to improve student achievement while engaging the community in conversations about what a successful education in Springfield should look like. \"From my perspective, that's a question that the community answers and I deliver,\" he said.",

  "text": "Hugley-Green, Walker keep seats; Marvets new rep for Muscogee County School Board. Muscogee County school board members James Walker and Pat Hugley-Green will keep their seats, while local business owner and parent Norene Marvets will be District 7's new representative. In the District 1 race, incumbent Pat Hugley-Green collected 4,782 votes, Mary Walker got 2,204 votes, and Christopher Seldon received 568 votes. In the District 3 race, James Walker gathered 4,225 votes to challenger Duane Melvin's 1,902. In the District 7 race, Marvets received 2,478 votes, and opponent Ryan Newbern collected 1,756 votes. This is the second time Walker has beaten out Melvin for the school board's District 3 seat. The two ran against each other in 2004. Tuesday night, Walker collected about 69 percent of the vote. \"I feel great,\" he said after the race was called by the Ledger-Enquirer at about 9 p.m. He said he was out to win, but that the race was not about him \u0097 it was about the children. \"I love what I do,\" Walker said. \"I do it for the children.\" Both candidates campaigned on improving student achievement and preparing for the students expected after the U.S. Army relocates the Armor School from Fort Knox, Ky., to Fort Benning. Growth due to the Base Realignment and Closure is expected to bring about 6,500 students to the Muscogee County School District. \"We will continue to help the schools get better,\" Walker said. \"We only have a few schools that are not making AYP.\" Walker, a retired insurance agent, has served on the board for 14 years and is currently its chairman. Melvin is a retired Army major who works as a unit manager in the Stewart County Detention Facility in Lumpkin, Ga. Hugley-Green collected about 63 percent of the vote. Challengers Mary Walker and Seldon received 29 percent and 8 percent of the vote, respectively. Hugley-Green has been on the board for one four-year term. During her tenure on the board, she has helped get pay raises for all employees, campaigned to rename Eastway Elementary as Lonnie Jackson Academy and fought to build a new Rigdon Road Elementary School. Walker is a real estate broker and former educator who ran against Hugley-Green in 2004 and lost. She taught at Reese Road and Claflin elementary schools. Seldon is an electrical contractor who has volunteered as a coach, mentor and tutor at the YMCA and Clubview Elementary. In the District 7 race, Marvets gathered about 58 percent of the vote. Newbern received about 41 percent of the vote. The incumbent, Joe Roberson, did not seek re-election. Marvets is the mother of six children and has been involved with area schools as a PTA president and as a member of the MCSD Sex Education Committee. She and her husband own John Paul Jeweler's on Warm Springs Road. Newbern is a student at Chattahoochee Valley Community College. He moved to District 7 to help care for his grandmother and works in sales for Knology. After he receives his associate's degree in liberal arts from CVCC in the spring, he plans to attend a four-year college. The board's District 5 seat also was up for election this year, but candidate Rob Varner, vice president of Synovus Securities, ran unopposed as incumbent Fife Whiteside did not seek re-election. The new representative will join the board in January 2009.",

Pierce received 47,876 votes, or 69 percent of the vote. Rae received 21,049 votes, or 31 percent. \"It's a very humbling thing to be elected again,\" Pierce said. \"I'm very grateful to the voters and I promise I'll do the best job possible.\" Pierce, 56, has held the clerk position since 1989.

  "text": "Election Day voting lines are smooth sailing. Voters turned out early and in force Tuesday on both sides of the Chattahoochee River, helping spread out election crowds and keeping lines relatively short as the day wore on. \"It was a lot busier this morning than in the past election, but I don't ever remember there being a slowdown like this in the afternoon,\" Sharon Ware, polling manager at the Blackmon Road Middle School precinct, said about mid-afternoon. Approximately 600 voters had moved through the lines there by that time. Volunteers at several voting precincts in Columbus reported 50 or more voters waiting for them in the dark to open their doors at least an hour before the official poll starts polls opened. Matrid Perdue, chief inspector at the Central Activities Center precinct in Phenix City, estimated more than 100 were in line as her polls precinct opened at 8 a.m. EST. \"They were from the front door all the way down the sidewalk to the street,\" she said. There were no problems, Perdue said, with nearly 1,800 votes being cast at the precinct by about 4 p.m. She predicted the total there might reach 2,200 before the day was done. \"We have had no disgruntlements,\" she said. \"Everyone's been very, very nice. No one has complained. No one has fussed.\" Part of the heavy morning turnout in Phenix City may have been caused by fact that because Alabama does not have advance voting like Georgia. Alabama also still uses paper ballots that are tallied electronically by voting boxes. Columbus election officials said last week that more than 38,000 voters in the city had cast votes early. The city's voting system is completely computerized. Mac Jones of Phenix City, after casting votes voting with his wife, Rosie, said he expected lines to be long there. He was pleasantly surprised at the smooth flow despite the crowds coming and going around him. \"Perhaps it is Barack; everybody's excited about that,\" Jones said of the enthusiastic turnout for an election that pitted Barack Obama, the nation's first black major party presidential candidate, against John McCain, whose running mate, Sarah Palin, was vying Tuesday to be the country's first female vice president. \"It's going to be history one way or the other.\" One of the largest opening crowds appeared to be at Rothschild Middle School. When poll manager Sandy Dowdell drove up to the school at 5:30 a.m., he was surprised to see about 50 people standing in line. Some of them brought folding chairs and blankets. By the time the precinct opened at 7 a.m., there were about 250 in line, he said. From 7-10:30 a.m. things were very the precinct was busy, he said. But election planners had many tools an answer to ease the crunch. \"People were saying how orderly and organized it was,\" Dowdell said. \"There were a lot of first-time voters. I know there were three 18-year-olds voting for the first time. Their mothers brought them.\" Because the voter turnout was predicted to be huge this year, each precinct set up queue lines similar to those at amusement parks.",

  "text": "Hyles unseats Turner for Municipal Court Judge. Columbus attorney Stephen Hyles has unseated Municipal Court Judge Haywood Turner. According to unofficial vote totals, Hyles had 61 percent of the vote to Turner's 39. Hyles finished with 42,600 votes to Turner's 27,058. \"I intend to work hard to make sure the people who supported me are glad they did so,\" Hyles said. \"I intend to work to earn the support of those who did not support me and hope to earn their support so they will support me the next time.\" By the time the results were final \u0097 after 1 a.m. \u0097 Turner had left his campaign headquarters and was unavailable for comment. This was the first time that Turner has faced opposition since he was elected unopposed two decades ago. Hyles, a defense attorney, was on Columbus Council from 1986-93. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor in 1992, when Bobby Peters was elected for his first of two terms. Hyles geared up his campaign to take advantage of early voting, and it appeared to pay off with a big advantage in the votes cast before Tuesday. \"There has been a paradigm shift in the election process,\" Hyles said. \"Nov. 4 is no longer the election day. It is only the last day to vote.\" Prior to the election, Turner admitted he was surprised that a challenge came from Hyles. \"There is no inference to suggest he is anything other than a good man,\" the judge said. \"He is more civilized than I and deserves a court with a higher jurisdictional limit.\" Turner has been in the news a number of times, most recently in April 2007 when he was accused of pointing a gun at another motorist. He was convicted of reckless driving, a charge that was reduced from pointing a pistol at another. He was sentenced to 12 months on probation, fined $1,000, ordered to perform 40 hours of community service and required to attend an anger management class. At the time, the police report stated that Turner said the gun was in its holster when he held it up. Today, he says he never pointed the gun at the other driver. He waved an empty holster, he said. \"I never brandished a gun,\" Turner said. \"I did not even own the type of gun described.\" In August 2002, Turner was in the middle of a pay dispute with Columbus Council. He was reluctant to issue a $625 fine to a California man for speeding, fearing that the money would likely be \"wasted\" in the hands of the city. That same morning, when a citizen complained about city inaction over a traffic signal, Turner turned up the volume by suggesting that setting off \"a nuclear bomb atop the Government Center\" might be the only way of getting Columbus councilors' attention. He later apologized for the remarks that angered city officials. In the aftermath, Turner's salary was raised from nearly $72,000 to almost $90,000. Today, the Municipal Court judge's job pays about $105,000 annually. Both men ran a clean campaign. Hyles has steered away from making a campaign issue out of Turner's behavior, declining to mention it at any campaign forum, debate or function.",

  "text": "Early voters help Slater take D.A. office. In a race that first appeared too close to call, Columbus' advance votes look as if they've catapulted challenger Julia Fessenden Slater into the District Attorney's Office. Democrat Slater, 42, took 71,445 votes, or 56 percent. Incumbent Republican Gray Conger took 55,486 votes, or 44 percent. Those numbers include precinct returns and in-person absentee voting in Columbus. Throughout the six-county circuit, 92 percent of the vote had been counted as of 1:30 a.m. today. \"We remained very encouraged,\" Slater said about watching the poll numbers come in. \"It was a bit of a roller coaster. It was a very energetic atmosphere.\" All precincts from the six counties in the Chattahoochee Judicial Circuit had not yet come in as of 1 a.m. today. Slater is an attorney in private practice. She worked in the District Attorney's office for 10 years before becoming a defense attorney. Slater had said she wanted to run for the office because she saw a need for change and because she was approached by various people who wanted her to run. Conger, 62, was appointed district attorney in 1995 and first elected to it the next year. He's served in the office since 1973. He's had opportunities to run for other positions but said he wanted to remain on the third floor of the Columbus Government Center where the district attorney has its offices. Conger had said he wanted to continue in his job to oversee high-profile cases such as the Doctors Hospital slayings and the double homicide in Harris County. Also, he has plans for slight personnel changes, perhaps shifting employees to different positions. Conger had said he feared some of his employees wouldn't have stayed in the office if his opponent won. He pointed to a recent murder case with three defendants prosecuted by an assistant of his. Conger said that case was beyond the ability of 90 percent of prosecutors, and he didn't want to lose employees like that.",

How else do you come to be known as \u201cThe Fish Man\u201d by people from as far as Texas and Washington, D.C.? Shivers has spent more than a decade traveling to festivals and football games around the country, where he unhitches a trailer and goes to work frying up croaker, whiting, perch and pretty much any other good-tasting seafood he can find. Now, he's going full time with a restaurant that opened this month on White Street about a mile east of downtown Rock Hill. Shivers hopes customers at the new joint, called Ernie's Place, will learn the reason behind his nickname. \u201cPeople line up just to get that fish,\u201d Shivers said. \u201cThey like my cooking. I think it's just God's gift, because my ingredients really aren't that complicated.\u201d At 57, Shivers is ready to do what he enjoys after a life spent in various jobs. He's driven a truck, fixed cars and worked in textile mills. But the need to fry has never left him. Dressed in white slacks, a chef's hat and a red apron and bandanna, Shivers looks as at home in the kitchen as Tiger Woods on the 18th hole at Augusta. It has been this way since Shivers was 16, cooking his own dinner every night while he earned his GED. \u201cI was just meant to be a cook,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried all kinds of things, but cooking stuck with me.\u201d Any owner will tell you that running a restaurant is a grueling business. The building on White Street has changed hands a number of times over the years. But Shivers says he'll get plenty of help from his wife, Thomasenia, and son Shaune, 26, who helps with the cooking and is said to make a mean peach cobbler. Shivers has already proven himself to an audience with high standards, said friend A.C. Jamison. That would be the students and alumni at Columbia's Benedict College. They flock to The Fish Man's trailer every year at the annual Harambee festival. Jamison, the father of former University of North Carolina basketball star and NBA standout Antawn Jamison, stopped in for a cheeseburger one afternoon last week. He knows Shivers through the Elks Club, where they both are members. Turns out, they don't call Shivers \u201cThe Burger Man,\u201d but he makes those pretty well, too. At Benedict, Jamison said, they know the difference between a real cook and a pretender. \u201cIf you don't know what you're doing, you won't get invited back,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to food, they don't play. If they don't like something, they'll let you know.\u201d Aside from seafood and burgers, the menu at Ernie's Place includes turkey wings, hot dogs and hush puppies. Monday brings the rib plate special, with beef stew not far behind on Tuesday. But the fish, Shivers hopes, will keep them coming back. The secret lies in the mix of spices and breading that he uses to coat the fish before dropping them into the fryer. So what's the recipe? \u201cI don't give that away,\u201d Shivers said. \u201cSomebody will try to duplicate it.\u201d Like a magician, \u201cThe Fish Man\u201d doesn't reveal his secrets.",

The Tega Cay Volunteer Fire Department and Flint Hill Fire Department responded to the blaze, which began in the master bedroom and was contained to that area, according to Tega Cay Fire Department Chief Scott Szymanski. The entire second floor of the home suffered significant smoke damage, Szymanski added. Alexis Butler, a 2000 graduate of Fort Mill High School, was the only person home at the time of the fire. Butler was sleeping in the master bedroom when she awoke to smoke filling the room. She said she saw a small fire and tried to put it out with a glass of water she had beside the bed, but quickly realized the fire was spreading too quickly for her to extinguish. She rushed out of the home and called the fire department. The fire was extinguished by approximately 10 a.m., officials said. The cause of the fire is believed to be electrical, Szymanski said. After the fire was out, firefighters spent the morning tossing debris out of the shattered master bedroom window, searching for any \u201chot spots\u201d that might remain in the home, Szymanski said. Butler and her family, including her mother Diane Butler, who owns the house, will stay with her aunt, Susan Grubb, who also lives in Tega Cay. As Alexis Butler stood on her neighbor\u2019s lawn, surveying the damage caused by the fire, she wondered aloud about the condition of her clothes, which were inside the bedroom closet. \u201cCan you get the smoke out of clothes?\u201d she asked.",

  "text": "State lawmakers say cigarette tax hike likely. COLUMBIA -- The sometimes-fierce nine-year battle over raising South Carolina's lowest-in-the-nation cigarette tax could end quietly this month. S.C. House Republicans and Democrats think they have a plan both sides can support to increase the tax. The plan is modeled after an Oklahoma program that uses cigarette tax revenue to secure matching federal money. That federal money then is used to provide a subsidy to buy health insurance for low-income residents or small businesses that could not afford insurance. \u201cIt looked like Oklahoma found a way to include the federal match,\u201d said House Speaker Bobby Harrell, the plan's author. \u201cThat is critical to making sure there is enough money in the fund to cover a large number of uninsured people.\u201d Last year, the House and Senate approved a 50-cent-a-pack increase. But disagreement over how the money would be spent meant the House could not override Gov. Mark Sanford's veto. If approved by the federal government, the House plan would raise the state cigarette tax by 50 cents a pack, raising about $147 million. That money, matched about 2-for-1 with federal Medicaid money, would provide tax credits to employers worth about 75 percent of the cost of buying health insurance for their employees. \"This is a compromise between people who want something tax-neutral and those folks who want to expand Medicaid,\" Harrell said. Additionally, about $5 million a year would pay for efforts to help people quit smoking. The state currently provides no money to help pay for smoking-cessation efforts.",

  "text": "Local officials making priorities for stimulus money projects. From an improved U.S. 21 bridge over the Catawba River to more guards at the county jail, local government officials are pursuing federal stimulus money for a host of priorities. Some are road widenings aimed at easing traffic or kickstarting multimillion dollar private developments. Others are described as urban renewal efforts to help neighborhoods with high crime rates move toward stability. Because so many places are competing for dollars, there is uncertainty over which requests will actually get money. \u201cYou can imagine all the other cities and counties doing what we're doing,\u201d said York County Council Chairman Buddy Motz. \u201cEverybody is scrambling to try to get some of the funds. We just need to make sure we're in the line.\u201d In many cases, the projects have been on the books for months or years, but sufficient money hasn't been available. One example is the U.S. 21 bridge over the Catawba River. Local leaders have long wanted to replace the famously narrow two-lane bridge, where drivers can come within inches of each other as they pass. But plans call for more than just a new bridge. Under an agreement between Rock Hill, Fort Mill and York County, the new version would get pedestrian and bike lanes, light poles and a new fa\u00e7ade aimed at making it a more distinctive feature. Supporters say the enhanced bridge could be a landmark along Interstate 77, and a popular attraction for hikers and kayakers along the Catawba River, where the Carolina Thread Trail runs through York County. Other projects have a more direct connection to spurring private investment. A private group planning a $600 million redevelopment at the old Celanese site has said Cel-River Road must be improved before it can move ahead with its plans. The proposed Riverwalk development will house one of the biggest industrial parks in the Charlotte region, along with a shopping center similar to Birkdale Village in Huntersville, N.C., and hundreds of homes and townhouses. It will take 10 to 15 years to complete, but officials say an improved Cel-River Road is the key to getting started. \u201cIt overshadows all the rest of them,\u201d said Rock Hill City Manager Carey Smith, in terms of economic impact and job creation. \u201cIt allows that industrial park to take off.\u201d The top priority is the S.C. 5 Bypass widening, which would widen the road from S.C. 5 west to S.C. 161. An estimated $19 million is needed to complete the project. Other projects are listed, along with cost needed to complete them: Roads aren't the only items on the list. County leaders also hope to use stimulus money to hire corrections officers at the Moss Justice Detention Center. The county has already hired 16 officers, but needs another 31 to man the expanded facility. Beginning corrections officer cost the county $43,743 in salary and benefits per year. \u201cYou can imagine, this is about the worst possible time to be adding 31 people,\u201d County Manager Jim Baker said. \u201cIf we're relying on our own resources, it'd be very difficult. We'd either be faced with not opening the facility or potentially pulling some of our deputies from the street.\u201d The path to securing stimulus money is anything but direct, with various pots of dollars available in different places. Legislation approved by Congress makes money available in education, technology, law enforcement and infrastructure. The Rock Hill school district would use stimulus money to replace funding that has been cut by the state, said Harriet Jaworowski, associate superintendent for instruction. Rather than launching new initiatives, the money would be put toward existing needs, such as tutoring programs. Some stimulus money could go directly to neighborhoods. For example, Rock Hill wants $180,000 to help build an asphalt trail connecting the Hagins-Fewell neighborhood to downtown. On the Saluda Street corridor, where revitalization efforts have been under way for years, officials are seeking $250,000 to create a gateway entrance at the S.C. 901 intersection. Plans call for a monument sign and landscaping to greet drivers entering Rock Hill's south side from I-77. Meanwhile, the county might pursue money to create a summer work program for youth. With entry-level jobs now being taken by adults, high school and college students are expected to have a tougher time finding work when school lets out. Included in the stimulus package is money to put youths to work picking up litter, making repairs to public buildings and doing office work. Baker heard about the work program in a conversation just last week, and asked his staffers to look into it. It's emblematic of how this unprecedented process is playing out \u2013 the people in charge are learning as they go. \u201cAs soon as we hear about an opportunity, we're trying to evaluate it,\u201d Baker said.",

  "text": "'Syria pressuring Cyprus over Iranian arms ship'. The EU and Syria are engaged in a tug-of-war over an intercepted ship suspected of transporting explosives from Iran to Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, European diplomats said Wednesday. The Cypriot-flagged Iranian arms ship Monchegorsk anchors off the Cypriot port of Limassol. Photo: AP The US military said it could not legally detain the ship, which it said was headed for Syria. The vessel continued on to Port Said, Egypt, and then on January 29 docked in Cyprus, where its cargo - described by Cypriot officials as material that could be used to manufacture munitions - was offloaded. The Cypriot government says the ship breached a UN ban on Iranian arms exports. A government official from a country in the region told the AP that Ghufari's delegation \"was instructed to reach secret agreements with Cyprus\" that would allow the Syrians to receive at least part of the cargo at the Syrian port of Latakia. Two Cypriot government employees familiar with Ghufari's visit could not confirm that, saying the subject was not broached at least in formal meetings the Syrian official had with his Cypriot hosts. Cyprus, with its nearest coastal point only less than 100 kilometers west of Syria, has traditionally been close to the Arab world. But the Greek-majority island is geographically part of Europe and joined the European Union in 2004, a move formally aligning it with the 26 other nations of the bloc.",

Pulitzer-prize winning author Alice Walker, who wrote \"The Color Purple,\" is traveling to Gaza along with other female activists to highlight the devastation wrought by the three week long Israeli offensive against the Hamas terror rulers of Gaza. Pulitzer-prize winning author Alice Walker, who wrote \"The Color Purple,\" is traveling to Gaza along with other female activists on Sunday. Photo: AP Walker, who was making her first trip to Gaza, said it was important for Americans who give so much military aid to Israel to understand how their money was being used. Walker is part of a group of about 60 women going to Gaza to deliver aid and meet with NGOs and residents. The trip, organized by the US anti-war group Code Pink, is intended to push both Israel and Egypt to open the borders into Gaza, said Medea Benjamin, co-founder of Code Pink who helped organize the trip.",
