  "text": "Analysis: PA officials welcome failure of Schalit talks. Some Palestinian Authority officials in Ramallah have welcomed the failure of the prisoner exchange negotiations between Israel and Hamas as good news. Palestinian women attend a protest held by the Islamic Jihad movement calling for the release of prisoners jailed in Israel. Photo: AP \"I know several Palestinian officials here who were happy to hear that the talks between Israel and Hamas had collapsed,\" he said. \"They were concerned that such a deal would embolden Hamas and undermine the credibility of Fatah.\" The reopening of the crossings, especially the Rafah terminal, would only help Hamas tighten its grip on Gaza, the official pointed out. \"We must not forget that Hamas seized power in the Gaza Strip through a military coup [in 2007]. As such, Hamas is not a legitimate authority there,\" he said. The PA was also worried the release of hundreds of Hamas operatives to their homes in the West Bank would have created a big headache for its security forces. The PA would have preferred to see many of the Hamas prisoners and their families \"relocated\" to other areas, such as the Gaza Strip. Hassan Salameh, Ibrahim Hamed, Abdullah Barghouti, Abbas a-Sayed and Jamal Abu al-Hija were behind one of Hamas's deadliest military infrastructures in the West Bank. As experts in preparing various types of explosive devices, they are responsible for the killing of hundreds of people during the second intifada. Abbas's aides are not worried as much about the parties that would be held for the released Hamas prisoners as about the high probability the released men would rebuild their movement's military infrastructure in the West Bank and resume terror activities not only against Israel, but also against the PA. The crackdown, PA officials explained, was a preemptive measure designed to thwart any attempt by Hamas to extend its control to the West Bank. As far as these officials are concerned, the tough anti-Hamas measures are \"working.\" Today, there's almost no such thing as a Hamas political or military leadership in the West Bank, since most of the movement's prominent figures are either in Israeli prisons or in Abbas's detention centers. Another PA official said the only way to \"minimize the damage\" resulting from a prisoner exchange deal with Hamas was by persuading Israel to release a large number of inmates as a gesture to Abbas and Fatah. He said it would be a \"disaster\" for Abbas if Israel released important prisoners such as Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti in the context of a deal with Hamas and not Fatah.",

Immigration agents arrested 239 people on immigration violations in Worthington, out of a total of more than 1,200. Twenty of them were also charged with identity theft or related counts. Ericksen ruled that the government's search warrant established a sufficient basis for questioning the workers about their citizenship, and that the agents were entitled to detain people who were present there.",

  "text": "Lamar County sales tax still booming. Paris and Roxton continue to reap sales tax benefits from the construction of natural gas pipelines through Lamar County and a compressor station near Howland. Paris showed a 22.83 percent increase in January sales tax collections compared to a year ago and Roxton showed a 48.84 percent increase, according to a report on March sales tax distributions Friday by Texas Comptroller Susan Combs. Local entities receive half of the sales taxes collected on materials purchased for the pipeline with the municipalities where purchases are made receiving half. Both Sun Valley and Toco showed gains in March distributions on taxes collected in January. Sun Valley\u2019s March check for $5,039 was up 15.92 percent from March 2008 while Toco received $4,365.75, an increase of 18.88 percent. Combs delivered $433.4 million in March sales tax payments to Texas cities, counties, transit systems and special purpose taxing districts, down 0.6 percent compared to March 2008. But for the calendar year, local sales tax allocations remain up 2.2 percent compared to the first three months of 2008. \u201cState sales tax collections declined in February as important sectors such as retail trade and construction continue to struggle,\u201d Combs said. \u201cWhile state sales tax revenue has grown 2.8 percent through the first half of fiscal 2009, further declines are expected as the economy continues to weaken.\u201d Paris collected $597,667.29 in March based on January sales taxes compared to $486,559.61 in 2008. Year to date the city has received $2,104,006.98 compared to $1.623,427.54 in 2008. (See accompanying chart.)",

  "text": "Paris PD: Gang initiation text is a rumor. A rumor spread across Northeast Texas through text messaging \u0097 warning people to stay away from Walmart because a gang initiation is supposedly going to take place involving the killing of three women in a Walmart parking lot \u0097 has no credibility, according to Paris Police Department officials. \u201cAs far as we can tell, it sounds like a hoax,\u201d said Matt Birch, PPD crime prevention officer. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to stay away from Walmart.\u201d The PPD said in a release that some people in the community, mostly young people from what the police department has been able to establish, received the message and passed it on to others in the community. The text message does not specify a particular Walmart, so each community thinks it is the store in their community, the release stated. \u201cWe do not believe the text message is factual,\u201d Birch said. \u201cThey are getting hit all over the Metroplex with it. It\u2019s a Northeast Texas thing, not just a Paris thing.\u201d Also, Birch said another reason to doubt the authenticity of the message is the fact that gang initiations are not usually publicized events. \u201cGangs aren\u2019t going to advertise their initiations,\u201d Birch said. The police department was alerted to the text messages on Wednesday. Birch said law enforcement agencies in the DFW Metroplex area are investigating the source. The PPD then informed the Paris Walmart store and stepped up extra patrols as a precaution. \u201cAlthough several Paris residents did receive the text message, at this time we have no reason to believe this is a valid threat to the Paris Walmart or to our local community,\u201d the release stated. Birch said city dispatch has been inundated with calls about the message. \u201cWe do not believe the text message is factual,\u201d the release stated. \u201cPlease discount it if you receive questions regarding it.\u201d Dallas media stations reported the same message as a hoax as early as Wednesday night, and the message has also been reported as a hoax in other states across the country.",

Jessica Kay, 18, of Paris died Saturday in a Dallas hospital from injuries received in the Friday night collision involving a Ford Bronco driven by James Barnes, 20, of Paris and a Toyota Camry driven by Christina Boren, 28, also of Paris. Kay, along with two other passengers in the Bronco and the driver were transported to Paris Regional Medical Center before Kay was transported by helicopter to Dallas. Boren also was transported to the hospital. A three-year-old passenger in the Boren vehicle, seated in the center rear, was not injured, according to Paris Police Department public information officer Matt Birch. All other accident victims were treated and released. According to police reports, the Ford Bronco was traveling north on FR 1497 at Loop 286 when it collided with the Toyota Camry, which was westbound on Loop 286. Reports indicate the Bronco failed to yield right-of-way and was struck in the westbound lane of Loop 286. Barnes was cited for failure to yield right of way, Birch said. The accident remains under investigation.",

  "text": "Council looks over \u2018to do\u2019 list. Paris City Council asked the city manager to expand an 18-to-24-month bullet point strategic business plan presented at Monday night\u2019s council meeting out 10 years and to meet with Paris Junior College president Dr. Pam Anglin and Chamber of Commerce president Pete Kampfer for assistance. The plan has been a point of contention between City Manager Kevin Carruth and some council members for the past year. District 6 Councilman Edwin Pickle was first to question the brevity of the plan followed by Councilman Steve Brown. The District 4 councilman said he was not consulted for input as referenced by Carruth\u2019s statement in the council package that \u201cmost council members did not indicate a particular preference in format or content, however the consensus was a simple bullet of \u0091to do\u2019 list that would cover the next 18-24 months and could be utilized in planning for the FY 2009-2010 budget.\u201d \u201cI guess I am not part of the consensus, so it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Brown said. Pickle asked council members directly, \u201cI just want to make sure there was a consensus and we are happy with a simple bullet or \u0091to do\u2019 list,\u201d Pickle said. District 7 Councilwoman Rhonda Rogers said themanager\u2019s plan \u201cis an adequate beginning.\u201d \u201cI think we continue to develop a plan 10 years out,\u201d she added. Rogers also expressed concern that she saw nothing from any departments about what is in future plans to address services to outlying areas, particularly for those taxpayers who have requested disannexation because of lack of city services. \u201cI didn\u2019t see what the different departments are going to do toward helping them with whatever city services they feel like they need,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make them feel like they are part of the city.\u201d Pickle recommended, as he said he had done in the past, that Anglin be consulted to help on the strategic plan. \u201cDr. Anglin agreed and expressed a desire to help work on a strategic plan for the city \u0097 not for PEDC; not for the Chamber; not for the county,\u201d Pickle said. Mayor Jesse Freelen agreed that bringing Anglin into the equation \u201cis not a bad idea at all.\u201d Some long-term planning is needed but not necessary in every area of every department, District 2 Councilman Kevin Kear said. He cited airport development, wastewater treatment and water delivery as \u201csome big infrastructure I think we do need to have a general plan about where we are going.\u201d Freelen agreed that long-term planning in those areas would give future councils some type of guidelines as well as serve as a measurement tool to show \u201cwhere we have been and where we are going.\u201d Although Brown said he would have liked to have the bullet list presented Monday \u201c18 months ago,\u201d the councilman added, \u201cFrom this you look at it and then you make your strategic plan. I like that \u0097 at least we have a start now.\u201d Freelen asked Carruth to schedule a meeting with Anglin and Kampfer and to make regular reports on the planning process. In other business the council: received a favorable outside audit report for fiscal year ended Sept. 30 2008; rejected a disannexation request from three property owners; cancelled a May 9 election for unchallenged Districts 4, 5, and 7 incumbents; took favorable action on a Trail de Paris extension as well as a United Way early learning project on the trail; and, discussed the possibility of adding 10 hangars at Cox Field, estimated to cost $480,000. Council then spent a little more than an hour in executive session before reconvening the meeting and adjourning shortly afterwards. Pickle said prior to the meeting he had requested an executive session to discuss what is expected of the city manager, mainly in regard to the strategic planning process. Also in executive session, the council was to receive information about an incentive offer to a business prospect.",

  "text": "Commissioners hear from TxDOT on bridges. Texas Department of Transportation representative Richard Harper told Lamar County Commissioners Monday TxDOT has simplified the bridge repair process for counties, making it easier and quicker to begin work on matching funds projects. Harper said the list of structurally deficient bridges in Lamar County eligible to be replaced in the federal program can be speeded up if the county provides the paperwork involved in the matching funds process, but the county no longer has to wait months on the paperwork to begin its own work. \u201cThe process has been shortened to allow work to begin much quicker,\u201d he said. Harper said TxDOT has provided the county with a current list of 16 structurally deficient bridges. \u201cAll the county has to do now is submit its list of bridges it will repair as matching funds for the bridges TxDOT will repair or replace,\u201d Harper said. \u201cAs soon as that is done, the county can begin work on those projects, and the state can begin work on the structurally deficient bridges.\u201d In other action, commissioners issued a resolution formally approving the application to the Office of the Attorney General, Crime Victims Services Division for funding for the office of Lamar County Victim Witness Coordinator for the years of 2010 and 2011. The court also hired Ginger Cook of Funding Solutions to perform grant writing services for the 2009 Assistance to Firefighters grant for the Lamar County Volunteer Fire Departments. Lamar County Elections Coordinator Russ Towers asked commissioners to approve a licensing agreement with election Systems & Software, Inc., that would allow the county to print its own ballots in cases where the ballots are running short in any election. Commissioners approved the software licensing, training and hardware at a cost of $4,870. Towers said the move would ensure the county never runs short of ballots. Denise Dority of Resource Management & Consulting Company was given the right by the court to advertise for materials for water line replacement through the Texas Community Development Block Grant Small Towns Environment Program. Commissioners also approved Hayter Engineering for services for the rural Community Affairs Community Development Program projects, and awarded administrative services to Resource Management & Consulting Company. Commissioners also declared the month of April \u201cFair Housing Month\u201d in the drive for equal housing opportunities. The court set the time to demolish and remove the Hickory House building at 35 Graham Street at 8:30 a.m. April 1, when commissioners will bring their equipment to the site and erase the building. Commissioners also: received a certificate of completion from the County Judges and Commissioners Associa-tion of training for Commissioner Lonnie Layton; approved official bond and oath for Brandi Taylor as deputy clerk in the office of the Lamar County and District Attorney; approved a line-item transfer for Constable Gene Hobbs, moving gasoline funds to a capital account for the purchase of a vehicle; heard County Treasurer Shirley Fults\u2019 report for the month of January and a quarterly investment report; and, heard County Auditor Kevin Parson\u2019s report for January.",

By Bill Engle Staff Writer March 27, 2009 Luminous Electronics Recycling, a Denver-based company, was near announcing plans to open a new facility in Richmond, promising a $1.5 million initial investment in an existing building with hopes of hiring 50 to 70 workers within three years. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually identified a facility and negotiated a lease,\u201d Luminous company president Steve Fuelberth said Friday from Denver headquarters. \u201cBut part of our plan was to be able to access what the state of Indiana had to offer. \u201cOnce the program was dropped it caused us to step back and re-evaluate the exact location of that facility,\u201d he said.

Valerie Shaffer, manager of business attraction for the Economic Development Corporation of Wayne County, said she is still working with company officials to bring them here but admitted \u201cthey were discouraged when they heard the grant program had been frozen.\u201d Fuelberth agreed the deal is not dead but added that he will investigate incentives offered by surrounding states.",

Twenty-five-year-old Robert Coker was arrested Friday night, and 46-year-old Kenny Davis was arrested Monday. Both were charged with felonious assault and held in the Hamilton County jail. The agent wasn't hit by gunshot, but was cut by flying debris. The FBI has not released the agent's name.

  "text": "French filmmaker slammed for likening illegals to WWII Jews. France's immigration minister criticized a film director on Monday for likening the situation of illegal immigrants in France today to that of Jews under the Nazi occupation during World War Two. Director Philippe Lioret - whose film \"Welcome\" about illegal immigrants trying to reach Britain from northern France opens on Wednesday - has criticized a French law that makes it a crime to help illegal immigrants. \"To see that a decent guy can all of a sudden be charged and that he can go to prison is crazy. It feels like it's 1943 and we've hidden a Jew in the basement,\" Lioret told the regional newspaper La Voix du Nord last week. Some 76,000 Jews were arrested in France during World War Two and taken to concentration camps such as Auschwitz, where most died. Those found to be hiding Jews faced a similar fate. Immigration Minister Eric Besson told Europe 1 radio that comparing the plight of Afghans in the northern town of Calais to that of Jews during the occupation was \"intolerable\", and that Lioret had \"crossed the red line\". \"I have the impression that the film's promoters are committing a deliberate slur, no doubt with the intention of increasing publicity for the film's release,\" he said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy has promoted a controversial tough immigration policy, which is widely believed to have won him the support of many far-right National Front voters in the 2007 presidential election. Sarkozy's policies include setting targets for police on the number of illegal immigrants they must expel each year. \"Welcome\" tells the story of a middle-aged lifeguard at a Calais swimming pool who, while trying to win back his wife's affections, meets a young Kurd and helps him swim across the Channel to Britain, where the young man's girlfriend lives. Vincent Lindon, who plays the lifeguard, has also spoken out about immigration policy in the run-up to the film's release, denouncing the often squalid conditions in which immigrants live while attempting to find a way into Britain. \"I believe we must respect human beings. The people in Calais are often treated worse than dogs. And I don't like that,\" Lindon told the newspaper Le Parisien in an interview published on Saturday. \"I do not understand that there is an article of the (law) that says: 'Any person who helps a person in an illegal situation is punishable by up to five years in prison'.\"",

U.S. officials said Friday the State Department will spend about $1 million to renovate, reconfigure and furnish the Washington workspace of special Mideast peace envoy George Mitchell and outfit satellite offices for him in Jerusalem and in New York, where he lives. State Department spokesman Robert Wood said Friday that $27,000 has already been set aside to upgrade Mitchell's sixth-floor suite at the department's headquarters and that more money may be needed. Additional funding may be required for further work as staffing requirements and other needs are identified, Wood said. This reconfiguration and renovation is designed to enhance efficiencies and staff coordination for this very important mission. The cost of the other offices is still being determined, but officials say they expect the price for all three, excluding additional staff, to reach seven figures. Mitchell and his staff had been allocated rooms on the State Department's first floor near the offices of other special envoys such as Richard Holbrooke, Dennis Ross and Todd Stern, who handle, respectively, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Southwest Asia and the Gulf, and climate change. But officials said he wanted to be closer to the front office of the department's Near East regional bureau, which is located on the sixth floor and that the renovations were needed to adapt the available space there. Mitchell, the former Senate Democratic leader who negotiated the Northern Ireland peace accord, does not receive a government salary.",

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Saturday called Jerusalem \"the key for peace\" and said justice and peace would not come to the Middle East without \"an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.\" Addressing an audience at the opening of an event celebrating Jerusalem's role in Arab culture, Abbas reiterated calls for Israel to accept a two-state solution, vowing not to resume negotiations with Israel without an explicit Israeli recognition of previously signed agreements. Abbas said that \"any new Israeli government should reaffirm anew its commitment for peace by clearly accepting the two-state solution, the road map peace plan and all commitments reached in previously signed agreements.\" He also stressed that \"without (Israel) halting all settlement activities, in Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied territories, there will not be serious and productive negotiations.\" Abbas stressed that the Palestinians want to reach \"an effective truce\" with Israel that would end bloodshed and hardships. He called on Israel to stop the destruction of Palestinian homes in Jerusalem and elsewhere in the Palestinian territories, describing this policy as one of \"ethnic cleansing.\" Jerusalem Police on Saturday dispersed a number of small events staged as part of the Palestinian Culture Festival, meant to declare the city \"the capital of Arabic culture for 2009.\" As of Saturday afternoon, police had shut down eight events and arrested 20 people, believed to be the events' organizers. Nonetheless, Palestinian officials say they plan to hold several events throughout the year to commemorate Jerusalem as the capital of Arab culture. Related articles:",

President Shimon Peres launched a campaign a few days ago whose aim is to convince the international community that the \"Netanyahu-Lieberman-Barak\" government in the making will advance the peace process with the Palestinians. Meanwhile, senior European Union officials have sent messages to Benjamin Netanyahu making it clear that a refusal to adopt the \"two-state solution\" means freezing any upgrade in relations between Israel and Europe. Peres seeks to allay European and Arab suspicions about the Netanyahu government and the appointment of Avigdor Lieberman as foreign minister. The president has been helping Netanyahu in his coalition negotiations with Kadima and the Labor Party, and was party to the secret talks between the Likud chairman and his Labor counterpart, Ehud Barak. In a phone call late last week to mark the 30th anniversary of Israeli-Egyptian peace, Peres told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that the agreements signed by Israel contain an obligation to promote a regional peace agreement as well as separate agreements with each of Israel's neighbors. \"In addition,\" Peres said, \"the new government will be obligated to honor all of the international agreements that have been signed.\" Sources close to Peres said yesterday that the president has transmitted similar messages in his talks with foreign leaders, which are expected to continue through Wednesday, when the new government is to be sworn in. Peres is to make an official visit to Prague on Monday, where he is scheduled to meet with the president, prime minister and foreign minister of the Czech Republic. The Czechs are the current president of the European Union, and according to sources in the President's Residence in Jerusalem, Peres intends to take advantage of his visit to present the coalition agreements to his hosts and to stress the new government's commitment to the peace process. \"It will be one of the main topics of the visit,\" the source said. In addition, immediately after the swearing-in ceremony for Netanyahu on Wednesday, Peres will launch a media blitz of interviews to the foreign press to explain the policies of the new government.",

  "text": "Assad: Syria still believes in peace with Israel. Syrian President Bashar Assad told the weekly magazine the New Yorker that though it may take some time, Syria still believes in the power of serious dialogue to produce a lasting peace with Israel. In an interview via email several days after Israel and Hamas declared unilateral cease-fires following Israel's three-week offensive in the Gaza Strip, Assad said that though Israel was \"doing everything possible to undermine the prospects for peace,\" he was still very interested in closing a deal. \"We have to wait a little while to see how things will evolve and how the situation changes,\" Assad wrote as Israel voted in a new government headed by Benjamin Netanyau. \"We still believe that we need to conclude a serious dialogue to lead us to peace,\" he declared. In the interview, Assad argued that Israel understands that the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Six-Day War, is not negotiable. \"The Israelis know that we are not going to negotiate the line of 1967,\" Assad wrote, but suggested that compromises were possible. \"We only demarcate the line,\" he wrote. \"We negotiate the relations, the water and everything else.\" ? You discuss everything after the peace and getting your land. Not before,\" Assad stressed. \"Hezbollah is in Lebanon and Hamas is in Palestine,\" Assad continued. \"If they want to solve the problem with Hezbollah they have to deal with Lebanon. For Hamas, they have to deal with Gaza. For Iran, it is not part of the peace process anyway. This peace is about peace between Syria and Israel.\" The Syrian president reiterated his stance that it was now, more than ever, \"essential that the United States play a prominent and active role in the peace process,\" explaining that Syria required direct contact with U.S. President Barack Obama in order to advance the diplomatic process. Assad also lauded the diplomatic efforts of former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, saying that \"Carter is most knowledgeable about the Middle East and he does not try to dictate or give sermons. He sincerely is trying to think creatively and find solutions that are outside the box.\"",

  "text": "Head of controversial Palestinian orchestra banned from West Bank camp . The head of a Palestinian youth orchestra who set off an uproar by performing a concert for Holocaust survivors in Israel was blocked Tuesday from entering a West Bank refugee camp because of concerns for her safety, a local official said. Security official Radi Asiba said the life of the orchestra conductor, Wafa Younis, would have been at risk if she remained in the area of the Jenin refugee camp. Younis, an Arab woman from Israel, led a small orchestra for Palestinian youths in the hardscrabble camp. But she fell out of favor with residents after taking the orchestra to play for the Holocaust survivors last week. \"When Younis tried to enter the camp on Tuesday, she was halted by a prominent local leader,\" Asiba said. \"We informed her that she is forbidden from entering Jenin because her presence causes tensions,\" he said. Younis struck a sensitive nerve. Many Palestinians are reluctant to acknowledge Jewish historical suffering because of concerns that it weakens their own claims to victimhood and to the land. Ignorance and even denial of the Nazi genocide during World War II are common in Palestinian society. Parents said they were not told their children would perform for the Holocaust survivors. Residents of the Jenin camp are descendants of the some 700,000 Palestinians who either fled or were expelled from their homes in the war that followed Israel's creation, an event Arabs call the Naqba, or catastrophe. They said they were angry with Younis because their children had performed for Holocaust survivors while Israel had not acknowledged the suffering caused to them. Younis was not available for comment on Tuesday but earlier said she only meant to spread goodwill through the concert. On Sunday, camp officials boarded up Younis' rehearsal studio and confiscated the orchestra's music instruments: an electronic keyboard, a few kamanjas - an Arab instrument that looks like a violin - and some small drums. Younis established the Strings of Freedom orchestra around three years ago in the Jenin refugee camp.",

  "text": "UN: 70% of Palestinian youth oppose violence to resolve conflict with Israel. Nearly 70 percent of Palestinian young adults believe the use of violence to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is not very helpful, according to a United Nations Development Program (UNDP) study released Tuesday. Only 8 percent believe violence is an important tool, the study, based on interviews with 1,200 Palestinians over the age of 17 in the West Bank and Gaza. The study also found out that more than 80 percent of young Palestinians are depressed, and 47 percent identify themselves as Muslim rather than Palestinian. It found that 39 percent were \"extremely\" depressed and 42 percent were depressed by their conditions. Depression was more marked in the Gaza Strip where 55 per cent said they were \"extremely\" depressed. When asked to define their identity, 47 percent identified themselves as Muslims, 28 per cent as Palestinians, 14 percent as humans and 10 per cent as Arabs. \"Young people are exceptionally vulnerable in a conflict situation. They are more likely to be injured, arrested or sucked into harmful situations,\" said Jens Toyberg-Frandzen, special representative for UNDP's Program of Assistance to the Palestinian People. \"At UNDP we have always understood that you cannot develop an economy or a nation without developing its youth, particularly when the economic and political environment appears to offer limited hope,\" he said. Unemployment rates for Palestinian youth range from 35 percent in the West Bank to 51 percent in Gaza, said UNDP. The survey of attitudes of Palestinian youth was part of a report commissioned by the UNDP and presented to a workshop designed to plan a strategy for youth development for the Palestinian Authority.",

  "text": "'He will not be forgotten,Kate, that I promise you'. The remains of Stephen Carroll are carried in Banbridge yesterday 'To the love of my life. I will never forget you. I love you now and always, Kate' IT was just after 1.20pm when one simple act illustrated the truly seismic changes brought about by the North's peace process. And then, in the middle of a Northern Irish town and watched by Protestants and Catholics alike, he walked behind the coffin of a murdered policeman. Twelve years ago -- when the last Northern policeman was shot dead -- such a public tribute by a southern policing figure would have triggered a riot. Most children watching the sad procession yesterday never knew what it was like to live with the almost daily torrent of bombings and shootings. They do now. Many had heard a police wife tell in a radio interview how their 12-year-old son tearfully begged his father not to go to work this week. He didn't want him to get shot. Some of those who once followed a violent path are now in the North's government. Some are not, but they still came to Banbridge yesterday. They faced the TV cameras and appealed for the killings to stop and said there was no popular support for the dinosaurs still wedded to the past. The requiem Mass for Mr Carroll brought together a remarkable coalition of former terrorists, police officers, church leaders and politicians of all hues. Banbridge also turned out in force to say goodbye. Thousands lined the three-mile route from Mr Carroll's home to St Therese's church. A three-minute silence was held in the centre of the town and then the cortege passed, 18 officers walking ahead of the hearse, six motorcycle outriders ahead of them. A piper played a lament called the 'Flowers of the Forest' and mourners wept as the hearse passed by. Amid the roses, carnations and lilies, a floral tribute had also been sent from England by the family of murdered soldier Sapper Patrick Azimkar. As well as cards from his own parents, son Shane, siblings and grandchildren, Mr Carroll's heartbroken widow Kate left her own simple tribute. It said: \"To the love of my life. I will never forget you. I love you now and always, Kate.\" Then, she watched as her husband's casket, clad in a PSNI flag, was borne into the church by six fellow officers. \"He will nor be forgotten Kate, I promise you,\" Mr Orde said, adding Mr Carroll (48) knew an unexpected violent act like this could one day happen given the hatred in some hearts. Canon Liam Stevenson, the Banbridge parish priest, told mourners the killing of Mr Carroll was designed to destabilise the peace process. The word patriot, he said, had been horribly abused. \"The killers of Constable Carroll have abused the term patriotism. \"A perfectly laudable aspiration such as patriotism is robbed of its intrinsic value when it's allied to violence and death in pursuit of its objectives.\" Bishop McAreavey ended by sending a direct message to the killers: \"You are greatly mistaken. Your way of thinking is backward looking. As soft rain began to fall outside, Bishop McAreavey's words were met by hope, tears and thunderous applause.",

  "text": "Five appear in court on St Patrick's Day violence charges. FIVE men have appeared in court in relation to allegations of a series of disturbances on St Patrick's Day. The men, ranging in age from 18 to 23, were brought before Tipperary District Court yesterday on charges relating to incidents on March 17 last on Main Street and Abbey Street in Tipperary town. Three of the men were granted bail in open court -- despite objections from gardai who feared they would attempt to intimidate witnesses -- while bail hearings in relation to the other two were held in camera. The hearings held behind closed doors involved Patrick O'Keeffe (19) of 19 St Ailbe's Drive, Tipperary, who is accused of carrying out assault causing harm, assault, and two breaches of the Public Order Act and Jimmy Delaney (23) of 1 Carrowclough, Tipperary, who is also accused of a breach of the Public Order Act as well as assault causing harm and escaping from custody at Abbey Street, Tipperary, on March 17. Dan Delaney (18) and Ned Delaney (21), both of 1 Carrowclough, Tipperary, had been in custody since last week on charges of being intoxicated in a public place, using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour and assaulting or threatening to assault a garda carrying out their duty. John-Paul Delaney (18) of Upper Abbey Street, Cahir, is charged with assault, assault causing harm and theft of a mobile phone at Main Street, Tipperary, on the same date. The court heard that he was arrested after four gardai entered his address while he was in bed, during a major garda operation on Tuesday. Opposing bail in respect of Dan Delaney, John-Paul Delaney and Ned Delaney, Detective Inspector William Leahy said that there was \"a larger group\" of people who were involved in a number of incidents of intimidation over the last year. Following the incidents on St Patrick's Day, he had looked back over files of complaints, \"and a pattern has arisen where witnesses who made complaints about assaults either refused to make statements or, having made those statements, subsequently came into the garda station and withdrew them, and that's my fear today\". \"It's the State's contention,\" said Inspector Pascal Feeney, \"that over the past 12 months a number of injured parties or witnesses have withdrawn their statements as a result of intimidation and fear.\" The applications for bail were made by solicitors Vincent McCormack and Philip English. Judge Anderson said, in relation to the case involving Dan Delaney, that it was up to the State to stand up any evidence of past intimidation and, as they could not do this, he was precluded from refusing bail. The same applied in the other cases he heard in open court.",

  "text": "Mum denies making up child death story in deportation battle. Nigerian woman Pamela Izevbekhai yesterday insisted she had not fabricated a story about the death of her baby daughter in order to be allowed to remain in Ireland. Ms Izevbekhai \"totally rejected\" allegations that she manufactured the story to bolster her case against deportation. \"I did have a daughter Elizabeth and she did die as I said,\" said the Sligo-based mother who has been fighting a long-running legal battle against deportation. She has consistently maintained that her first daughter died at the age of 17 months after being subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM) and has argued that if the family is sent back to Nigeria her two younger daughters would be subjected to the same procedure. The mayor of Sligo, Veronica Cawley, yesterday stood by her decision to hold a civic reception for Ms Izevbekhai last year while a spokesman for the Sligo-based Let Them Stay organisation said yesterday's reports raised more questions than they answered. Cllr Cawley said some people had suggested that she should apologise for holding the civic reception but she insisted: \"I have nothing to apologise for.\" At that function in Sligo Town Hall, Pamela wept as she said that Elizabeth would always be with the family and was a guardian angel for her sisters Naomi and Jemima. Cllr Cawley urged people not to jump to conclusions until all the facts come out. \"I have always said that the purpose of the civic reception was to highlight the barbaric practice of female genital mutilation and today I repeat my call for a worldwide ban on this torture,\" said Cllr Cawley. \"Before Pamela came to live in the north west, most us had never heard of FGM but there is a huge awareness now.'' \"These reports are only a snap shot in a long-running investigation which is not over yet,\" said Cllr Cawley. Cllr Cawley said that while a number of people had gone on local radio yesterday saying she should apologise for holding a civic reception for Ms Izevbekhai \"everyone who phoned me today was supportive\". Supporters of Ms Izevbekhai pointed out that while Lagos-based obstetrician Dr Joseph Unokanjo was now claiming that he had never delivered a baby called Elizabeth Izevbekhai, and that he had never treated her for post-FGM blood loss, a doctor of the same name has in the past given interviews to RTE and Ocean FM in Sligo saying the opposite and supporting Pamela's account. They also pointed out that he is now saying that the baby he delivered for Pamela in 2000 was her first baby but she has a teenage son Adrian who lives with his father Tony in Nigeria. A spokesman for Let Them Stay questioned why this material had been leaked now and whether there was an agenda behind it. \"The safety of these two little girls should still be the main issue and I wonder is the Irish government saying that it is safe to send them back to Nigeria?\" he said. \"We would like to see Dr Unokanjo come on Irish radio again and see what he has to say now.\" He said supporters were concerned about why these claims were being made now, four years after Ms Izevbekhai first outlined her fears.",

  "text": "Council is accused as sewage kills fish stocks . SEWAGE is pouring into a river, decimating fish stocks, after a local authority ignored advice to cease allowing building on an overloaded system. Mayo County Council is sanctioning several major developments in a town, despite a warning from the planning appeal board that housing schemes should not be built until the capacity of the area's 70-year-old sewage treatment facility was improved. Ironically, a 25-house development turned down by An Bord Pleanala when it issued its warning was later granted planning permission by the council when a new application was submitted. However, no significant upgrade works on the sewage plant, which only provides primary treatment of waste waters, had taken place in the intervening period. The housing developments, a 44-bedroom hotel and a 315sq metre office building, were all sanctioned after 2000 when the board issued its warning. Although the council says it has now prioritised the upgrading of the sewage treatment plant, a row between the local authority and the Department of Environment over funding has delayed the improvements. Concerned anglers have questioned the council's planning policy and say untreated effluent is now flowing directly into the River Pollagh, a tributary of the River Moy. Before it became polluted, the Pollagh was renowned for brown trout fishing and was also an important salmon spawning river. \"It appears the council has favoured development over the environment and the past 10 to 15 years have seen the gradual decimation of fish stocks and fly hatches. \"The town can no longer avail of game angling facilities nor can we attract visiting anglers as we did in the past.\" Mayo County Council said in a statement that it was \"happy\" with its policy regarding planning in Kiltimagh. \"Serious questions need to be answered as to how almost 200 houses, a hotel and an office building could be given permission by the council after An Bord Pleanala voiced serious concerns about any future development in the town without adequate sewage treatment facilities being put in place,\" said",

COLUMBUS -- The warmer temperatures are making the 33rd Avenue viaduct reconstruction workers\u2019 jobs much easier as construction continues on pace to meet the contractor\u2019s Nov. 3 targeted date to reopen the structure. The contracted deadline for the viaduct to be open to traffic is Dec. 5 with an incentive of $3,315 per day, up to 60 days, if the project is completed prior to the deadline. Penalties were also included in the contract for each day the viaduct was closed beyond Dec. 5. Dan Cramer, project manager for Cramer & Associates Inc., said the weather has provided better working conditions and hopes it persists. \u201cIt just makes the work a lot more comfortable and a lot more productive,\u201d Cramer said. But, he said, this early in the construction the timeline does not provide a good indicator as regards when the structure will be completed. \u201cThese schedules don\u2019t mean squat,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cWhen you see the steel show up, that\u2019s when the schedule will mean something.\u201d The support cables are already completed, but the timing is heavily dependent upon the delivery of the archway, which is being fabricated by Capital Steel Co. in Lincoln. Capital Steel \u201cis currently working on it,\u201d Cramer said, and as for delivery, \u201cwe are still shooting for early June.\u201d The 10-foot-diameter, 96-feet-deep drill hole was completed by subcontractor Longfellow Drilling last week and the placement of the steel rebar cage and the concrete pour was completed by Cramer & Associates, the primary contractor for the $12.9 million contract for bridge removal and replacement, road work, concrete pavement, street lighting and new sidewalks. To date, the six pier support shafts on the north side have been completed and the remaining three are expected to be completed within the next two weeks, Cramer said. \u201cWe are moving to the south side,\u201d he said, and the goal is to complete \u201cone this week and two next week. The columns (are scheduled) to be poured consistently, one or two a week for the next month.\u201d Removal of the north side was completed last week, which included excavation of the north side wall, Cramer said, and the erection of the north side retention wall, expected to begin this week, is a few weeks ahead of schedule.",

  "text": "Platte Co. tops 32K for first time. Census data released today show Platte County reaching an all-time population high of 32,072 as of July 1, 2008, an increase of 1.6 percent since the 2000 census. From 2007 to 2008, the population increased by 272 people, nearly a percentage point gain at .86 percent. The increase places Platte as the state\u2019s 10th most populous county. Overall in Nebraska, not even a third of the counties saw populations increase in 2008. The figures show 28 of Nebraska\u2019s 93 counties gained in population from July 2007 to July 2008. That\u2019s one more than in the previous year. All but one of the remaining counties lost population. Sherman County, which includes Loup City, held firm at 2,994. But an analysis from the University of Nebraska at Omaha\u2019s Center for Public Affairs Research shows changes overall were better than those seen in recent years. Small Hitchcock and Hayes counties in southwest Nebraska, for example, both gained population in the one-year period after several years of losses. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a one-year blip or something, but it\u2019s definitely interesting to see that,\u201d said UNO\u2019s David Drozd, a research associate. Dakota, Otoe and Washington counties, whose numbers typically go up, saw their populations fall. In December, the Census bureau reported the state gained 13,959 residents over the one-year period. That\u2019s the most Nebraska has seen in a dozen years. Drozd attributed the gain to people moving into Nebraska from states harder hit by the economic downturn, as well as a strong birth rate. Economic conditions also could have lured some people back to rural areas, including college students who returned to the farm, he said. \u201cBy and large, for rural areas, a lot of the commodity prices were relatively strong,\u201d he said. Several counties are seeing population levels unseen in decades. Lincoln County\u2019s population (North Platte) of 35,582 is closer than ever to its all-time high set in 1981. It needs about 220 more people to top it. Some counties that marked losses in 2008 saw their rates of decline slowing. Madison County, for example, lost just 20 people after losing hundreds after the closing of a Tyson Foods plant in 2006. The combined population of Douglas, Sarpy and Lancaster counties continues to creep closer to the 1 million mark. They now account for 52 percent of the state\u2019s population, having more than 931,000 residents combined. In 2000, they controlled nearly 49 percent of the state\u2019s population. With the 2010 Census quickly approaching, the latest estimates confirm a timely change of course within Nebraska\u2019s 3rd Congressional District. The district that includes more than three-fourths of the state lost about 2,700 people annually in the first six years of the decade. But in 2008, it gained about 150 people. Drozd estimates its total population now sits at 551,000. Every 10 years following the census, seats in the U.S. House of Representatives must be redistributed fairly among the states. In 2000, Nebraska\u2019s slow growth sparked concern that the state could lose a seat a decade down the line. More than 70 years ago, Nebraska had six congressional districts. The House lost seats in 1933, 1943 and 1963.",

  "text": "City woman fined for false assault accusation. COLUMBUS -- A 27-year-old Columbus woman who admitted to falsely accusing a Meadow Grove man of sexual assault in May 2008 has been fined and ordered to pay restitution for lying about the incident. Janae McMahon was fined $150 and ordered to pay $1,671 restitution on Wednesday in Platte County Court for her conviction of attempted false reporting. McMahon pleaded no contest to the reduced charge in connection with the May 28 incident after recanting her story of a sexual assault stemming from an encounter with the man she met over the Internet. The defendant, who was initially charged with false reporting, successfully completed court-ordered mental health counseling prior to her sentencing. McMahon paid the restitution for the police and medical expenses of the assault investigation late last year. Platte County Attorney Sandra Allen said she hoped the sentence imposed on McMahon didn\u2019t make law enforcement investigators \u201cgun-shy\u201d about making sexual assault arrests in the future. \u201cOn the face of it, (a fine and restitution) is not much of a deterrent to someone making a false accusation,\u2019\u2019 Allen said. On the other hand, people who falsely accuse others of crimes probably aren\u2019t deterred by the threat of punishment, she said. Defense attorney Denise Kracl said Thursday McMahon\u2019s successful completion of counseling, which her client began even before being ordered to by the court, was a factor at sentencing. The judge checked McMahon\u2019s progress and compliance with counseling requirements over several months and was \u201cvery fair\u201d in giving her that opportunity, Kracl said. \u201cThis has been a really unfortunate situation for everyone involved,\u2019\u2019 the defense attorney said. \u201cJanae is resuming her life and doing the best she can to put the whole incident behind her. This is as good of an outcome as she could have expected.\u201d False reporting is a Class I misdemeanor is punishable by a maximum of one year imprisonment, $1,000 fine or both and no minimum sentence. Attempted false reporting is a Class II misdemeanor is punishable by a maximum of six months in jail, $1,000 fine or both and no minimum sentence. The county attorney\u2019s office dismissed a first-degree sexual assault charge against 38-year-old Richard Pehrson II of Meadow Grove in late-June. The man faced up to 50 years in prison if convicted. McMahon later recanted her story after Pehrson underwent a polygraph examination, and she was brought in by law enforcement authorities for further questioning. Pehrson was held for about a week in the Platte County Detention Facility following his arrest. His bond was set at 10 percent of $150,000 and he was placed on unpaid administrative leave from his job as a psych tech at Faith Regional Center in Norfolk. Pehrson, who also served as a volunteer firefighter, got his job back when McMahon\u2019s lie came to light. Allen sent letters to Pehrson\u2019s employer and the fire department explaining how he had been falsely accused in the case. \u201cHe was not terribly angry,\u2019\u2019 said Allen recalling a telephone conversation with the Meadow Grove man. \u201cHe was happy to have his name cleared.\u201d Pehrson could not be reached this week for his reaction to his accuser\u2019s sentencing. The Meadow Grove man and city woman, according to court documents, met over the Internet in early-May and were corresponding by e-mail for three weeks before the incident. The two met once in a public park in Norfolk. Later in May, Pehrson was invited by McMahon to Columbus late the night of May 27 to watch a movie. In the early-morning hours of May 28, Pehrson said the two had consensual sex. In the days following the incident, McMahon sent Pehrson e-mails saying how much she missed talking to him. That\u2019s not the story McMahon initially told authorities. According to the arrest affidavit filed in the case by Columbus Investigator Gregory Sealock, the woman did invite Pehrson over to her home to watch a movie, but she later got tired and wanted to go to bed. The woman said she allowed Pehrson to sleep on her couch because he had been drinking beer and didn\u2019t want to drive to his Meadow Grove home, Sealock stated. The woman later \u201cawoke to find Pehrson in bed with her\u201d and described a sexual assault in graphic detail. Defense attorney Donna Tonderum, who represented Pehrson while serving as a deputy in the Platte County Public Defender\u2019s Office, said her former client felt \u201chumiliated by the whole experience.\u201d Tonderum said Pehrson was expecting McMahon to spend some time in the county lockup. \u201cI think he\u2019d be very disappointed by the outcome,\u201d she said.",

  "text": "More rural residents self-employed. OMAHA -- A University of Nebraska sociologist says the state\u2019s waning rural population is changing the way people do business. Randy Cantrell, with the university\u2019s Rural Initiative, said in most rural counties, between 18 percent and 30 percent or more of jobs are now due to self-employment. And, that accounts for virtually all job growth in rural areas. He believes the popularity of self-employment is on the rise in rural Nebraska. Cantrell hasn\u2019t been able to put his finger on such details through his research, namely an annual rural poll that surveys rural residents on well-being, policy and work issues. But he has a theory: The rural poll is asking the wrong question. In the past, people have been asked if they have a business. Cantrell realizes that may be leaving out those who still get a paycheck from their employers, but technically are private contractors. He used the example of inbound telemarketers, who he thinks can rightfully assert they have a business. As rural areas continue to see their population numbers fall, Cantrell said he expects that to put pressure on employers to shift away from the traditional way of doing business and rely on private contractors. \u201cThere\u2019s still a demand for service but not enough to support a business of several employees,\u201d he said. Cantrell details the phenomenon and other observations about Nebraska\u2019s economic and demographic changes in a new report based on 2007 census data and other federal statistics. Census data released this week shows the state\u2019s three largest counties \u201d Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy \u201d grew by 14,240 people collectively in 2008. The remaining 90 counties declined by 281. Cantrell said he plans to revise his report with the newly released information. The rural poll will take another shot at the \u201cbusiness\u201d question this year, which is on its way to 7,000 Nebraska households. The survey is conducted by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln\u2019s Center for Applied Rural Innovation in cooperation with the Rural Initiative and UNL\u2019s Department of Agricultural Economics. Cantrell\u2019s study also notes the continued decline of those under age 20 living in rural areas. All but seven counties in the state declined in this population group during this decade, he said in the report. Cherry County, for example, saw a 20 percent drop in people under age 20 between 2000 and 2007. He attributes the changes to people leaving the state \u201d likely for economic reasons \u201d and a decline in birth rates.",

  "text": "Students from 9 schools join in music event. COLUMBUS -- Most of the student musicians had never met before, and they only had a few hours to get in harmony before they would be performing together. Students from the Nebraska Centennial Conference were at Scotus Central Catholic Saturday for the honor band and vocal clinic. Several dozen students from the nine conference schools spent the morning and early afternoon practicing songs for concert held at the school later that day. Scotus had about 30 students taking part in the band and vocal concert. Guest conductors lead each of the groups. Dr. David Bohnert, director of bands at Wayne State College, lead the band, and Dr. Rhonda Fuelberth, associate professor of music education at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, directed the choir. Students had been learning their respective music a few weeks prior to the clinic, but Saturday was their first time performing as a group. That is one aspect that Scotus Senior Nicholas Raimondo enjoys about the clinic. \u201cWe are all working together instead of competing against each other,\u201d Raimondo said. Students also said another part that they like about the clinic is the opportunity to perform with different directors. The instructors each brought their own unique style to the clinic. Bohnert told the students as he was directing them during practice, that he wanted them to experience what it is like performing with a large and different group of people. \u201cIf you learn nothing else today, at least learn to listen. This is where we go from 70 different individuals to one band,\u201d Bohnert said. \u201cYou have to put yourself in the big picture.\u201d Students were chosen for the clinic by their instructors and by meeting certain criteria. The host site for the event rotates between the nine schools in the conference. E.J. Gardner, vocal music director at Scotus, said the arts, especially performing arts such as band and choir, help students develop into well-rounded people. \u201cThere is a music intelligence part of the brain, just like there is a math intelligence and a science intelligence. This is a way to feed the brain,\u201d Gardner said of the clinic. Scotus Central Catholic's Trenton Kuta and other students from the Centennial Conferece rehearse a song during choir practice Saturday afternoon at Scotus Central Catholic High School in Columbus.

  "text": "Fiscal skills top Lakeview priority. COLUMBUS -- The Lakeview Board of Education met Monday with representatives from McPherson & Jacobsen LLC to establish the major criteria they are looking for in a candidate to replace Superintendent Paul Calvert. The Omaha executive recruitment and development firm presented the five-phase approach it uses to help school districts hire administrative staff as well as a tentative calendar that includes a seven-week timeline and May 8 as the estimated date for the final decision of the board. The first phase was conducted during Monday\u2019s meeting as the board identified the five major criteria they are looking for in potential candidates. The top five skills and characteristics identified and ranked by the board, according to McPherson\u2019s tabulations, are, in order: 1. Strong fiscal skills; 2. Good communication skills; 3. Open-minded leadership; 4. Good team member and leader; 5. Extensive knowledge of local, state and federal policiesThe representatives asked each board member to identify characteristics they would like in a potential hire. Of note, \u201cthe best quality education for the kids\u201d was listed during the second time the representatives asked for each board member\u2019s ideas, but was not included in the top five based on McPherson\u2019s tabulation. After the list was compiled, it was condensed by consolidating overlapping criteria and each member was then asked to pick their top five and rank them in order. The application questions will revolve around the criteria identified, according to the McPherson representatives. Although honesty, integrity, respect and ethics were commonly listed by board members, Jerry Ehlers, lead consultant for McPherson & Jacobsen, said identifying factors for those characteristics were standard for each process. Ehlers encouraged the board to list criteria that would help them find a superintendent who would match the needs of the district and meet the challenges it faces. \u201cIt is understood if you are going to get the job you have to have those characteristics,\u201d he said. Ehlers made the board aware the district could be competing with other districts for an exceptional candidate and cautioned them not to hire a replacement just to fill the position. \u201cThere just aren\u2019t a ton of applicants out there. There are more people retiring and getting out of it then are coming through the pipeline,\u201d he said, so candidates \u201care interviewing you just as much as you\u2019re interviewing them. \u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t get a quality candidate because of the timing\u201d he advised the board to move forward with an interim superintendent for a year, Ehlers said. \u201cMr. (Glen) Morgan and I aren\u2019t hiring anybody, the patrons aren\u2019t hiring anybody, the students aren\u2019t hiring anybody. Only the six of you have a vote.\u201d At the board\u2019s request, Ehlers said the principal search to find a replacement for Bob Arp could be conducted for an additional $1,500, which would include advertising, recruitment screening and background and reference checks. The board tentatively set a special meeting for 11 a.m. Friday at Lakeview High School to discuss and vote on that proposal.",

  "text": "Couple found dead in condo. An elderly husband and wife were found dead Monday night in their downtown Hanover condominium in an apparent murder-suicide, authorities said yesterday. The bodies of Elliott Lewis, 84, and Barbara Lewis, 82, were discovered by two Hanover police officers, who responded to the complex at 85 S. Main St. after the couple's adult son grew concerned about their welfare and called the police. Yesterday, authorities released few details and said they were awaiting results of autopsies conducted by the state medical examiner's office, which should be released today. \"We have some preliminary assessments from people on scene, but it's inappropriate for me to say,\" Senior Assistant Attorney General Kirsten Wilson said during an afternoon press conference outside the Hanover police station. Authorities did say that soon after arriving at the condo Monday night, it was determined that only the Lewises were involved and that the public was not in danger. \"There are no outside forces,\" Hanover police Chief Nick Giaccone said. \"The community can rest assured that it is safe. It was fairly obvious from the beginning.\" Wilson declined to say if authorities had pinpointed who died first, a motive or a weapon, or if they had found a note at the scene. Authorities said they were interviewing the Lewises' neighbors and relatives yesterday. Giaccone said the Lewises had two adult sons and other family members scattered throughout the region and country. One of their sons, Spencer Lewis of Bethel, Vt., declined to comment yesterday when reached by phone. \"I am beside myself right now,\" said Spencer Lewis, a local singer-songwriter. Giaccone said the Hanover police had no prior contact with Elliott or Barbara Lewis. \"From the police perspective, they were not generally known to us,\" Giaccone said. The Lewises' 900-square-foot condominium is part of a 55-and-over complex adjacent to the CVS parking lot in downtown Hanover. The Lewises had lived in the building for about 10 years, Giaccone said. They were renters, according to Hanover Town Hall records.",

  "text": "Alleged assault victim lives with man's ex-wife. The man who claims that former Epsom police chief Henry Farrin assaulted him is the roommate of Farrin's former wife. Farrin, 43, was arrested March 11 on a charge of simple assault for allegedly attacking Howard Brown, 27, in the restroom of the American Legion Post 31 in Penacook. In a stalking petition filed with Concord District Court, Brown wrote that Farrin choked him and lifted him off his feet. When the charges were first publicized, neither the police nor Farrin's attorney, Tony Soltani, would say what the connection was between the two men. Since then, Brown has told the Monitor that he is a friend of Farrin's ex-wife. \"That's what I think his beef is with me,\" Brown said. Brown said he became friends with Farrin's former wife when he lived in an apartment next to the one where she was staying while going through her divorce. Brown later moved to a two-bedroom apartment and told Farrin's ex-wife that she could rent a room from him if she needed a place to stay. \"I never even sneezed in this guy's direction my entire life,\" Brown said. According to Brown's account, Brown, Farrin and Farrin's ex-wife were all at the American Legion, with separate groups of friends, on the night of March 6. Brown is not a member of the Legion, but he said he came with a colleague who is a member. Brown said he went to the bathroom, and Farrin walked in after him. As Brown was about to leave the bathroom, Farrin started speaking to him. \"All of a sudden I hear the guy say something: 'How does it feel to be a chump?' \" Brown said. \" (I said) 'Excuse me? If anyone's a chump, it's you.' \" Brown said Farrin walked toward him and asked Brown to repeat himself, which he did. \"He instantly looks at me, pins me up against a wall, picks me up off my feet,\" Brown said. Brown said he knew Farrin was a former police officer, so he did not hit him back, although he did insult Farrin verbally. \"I never touched him,\" Brown said. At that point, Brown said, a woman standing outside the door heard the scuffle and opened the door enough to see Brown pinned up against the wall. She called for help, and several men rushed into the bathroom and separated Farrin and Brown. Brown said he decided to file for a restraining order and press charges with the police because he was scared Farrin would one day hurt him or someone else. \"He's an ex-chief of a police department,\" Brown said. \"What's he doing grabbing a guy in a men's room? He called me a chump.\" Soltani said he plans to bring witnesses to contradict Brown's account and will try to discredit him.",

  "text": "Judge bars developer from sites. A Merrimack County Superior Court judge yesterday denied a request by Concord developer Kevin Guay to have access to his properties while state officials conduct a criminal investigation into possible environmental violations. Judge Diane Nicolosi wrote, \"the State's interest in maintaining the integrity of its crime scene and investigation warrants the temporary exclusion of Mr. Guay and his lawyer from the property until the search is completed.\" Nicolosi said the search warrant is similar to grand jury proceedings, which the court has recognized as being secret. \"It is in the public's best interest for the State to work at the site unfettered and to accomplish any necessary follow up without interference from the public or a criminal defendant,\" she wrote. On Thursday morning, the Concord Police executed two search warrants and cordoned off Guay's properties at 180 Clinton St. and on Villanova Drive. The Department of Environmental Services took soil samples and began excavating. A state helicopter was involved in the action. No one except for tenants was allowed on or off the property, including Guay. At 1 p.m. yesterday, Guay's attorney Brandon Giuda filed a petition with the court asking for access to the property. \"I'd think in the U.S., which is not a police state, observation of the police's extensive intrusion into someone's property, where they're destroying by excavating, should be observed,\" Giuda told the Monitor. \"We want to see what they're doing.\" At a hearing two hours later, Lauren Noether, senior assistant attorney general for the state Justice Department's environmental protection bureau, responded that Guay should not be allowed onto the property. She argued that his presence could compromise the investigation, jeopardize the safety of officers and be a health risk. During the hearing, several new details emerged about the investigation. Detective Sgt. John Thomas of the Concord Police Department's criminal division testified that officials started work at the Villanova Drive property, which they hoped to finish yesterday evening. They planned to start work on Clinton Street today, and hoped to finish by the end of the day. According to Noether, the warrant gave state officials seven days to finish their search, but Thomas said he hoped it could be completed by tonight. \"There's a lot of money involved from the city and the state,\" Thomas said. \"We'll try to finish tomorrow, but we don't know what's in there. If we find what we're expecting to find, it could be longer.\" On the Villanova Drive property, Thomas said there was a defined \"hot zone\" where the state had dug a hole and was removing hazardous waste, and from which at least one large item was removed yesterday. Noether said there were safety concerns, since state officials do not know what is buried. \"It's not entirely clear what's going to be exposed,\" Noether said. \"If it contains something like asbestos, it can be airborne.\" Noether described the area as \"one huge pit of junk\" that is being excavated by two Department of Environmental Services officials in protective gear. She also worried there could be something explosive, like a propane tank, buried on the property. Noether also said that the area includes a \"command zone\" where DES is communicating with the police, and communications could be compromised if someone else were present At the Clinton Street site, Noether said, one \"hazardous area\" was near the driveway, just past the police barrier, where there is a septic system and leach field. Noether said Guay would be allowed back on the property once state officials stopped digging and deemed it safe. According to a satellite picture of the property found through the Live Search Maps website, there is also a large pile of debris behind a barn on the Clinton Street property. Guay said yesterday that it was a pile of junk, which the city has inspected, and that it contained nothing hazardous. There are wetlands concerns on both properties, state officials said.",

  "text": "Body ID'd, cause of death unknown. The frozen body found earlier this week along the shore of Lake Opechee in Laconia has been identified as that of a Laconia man who went missing nearly three months ago. But the police still aren't sure how Bryan Harman, 28, died. The state medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy yesterday, identifying the body as Harman's. The autopsy found nothing suspicious - no wounds or signs of violence - and it could be months before toxicology reports come back, said Laconia police Capt. William Clary. \"There's nothing sticking out,\" Clary said. He said the autopsy also did not determine how long ago Harman had died, but \"we're saying at least several months.\" Harman was last seen on New Year's Eve. He had a fight with his girlfriend, his mother said when she called the police the next day to report him missing. The police began to investigate. Flyers were posted around Laconia. The police tracked Harman's cell phone and credit cards, but they weren't used, Clary said. Harman never picked up a paycheck from work. Months passed, and no one called to report anything, Clary said. On Wednesday, two people walking along nearby railroad tracks and searching the area for bottles spotted a body by the lake's shoreline. It was partly in the water and partly covered in ice, Clary said. The body, which was fully clothed, likely wasn't visible until recently, as snow began to melt, Clary said. The medical examiner's office took the body, and an autopsy was scheduled. Though an identification hadn't been made, Harman was the only missing person report that the Laconia police had pending, and they contacted his family to let them know a body had been found. \"We wanted to make sure they knew we were doing everything we could,\" Clary said. During the autopsy, the medical examiner was able to identify Harman with information his family had previously provided, including \"tattoos, body piercings, very good clothing description,\" Clary said. \"We had all that stuff on hand.\" Harman also had his wallet, including an ID from Alaska. Clary said Harman lived in Alaska \"for some period of time\" and said he thought Harman's father lived there also. Harman is listed as living on Dartmouth Street in Laconia. Yesterday morning, before the autopsy had been conducted, a woman answered the phone and identified herself as Harman's ex-girlfriend. She said she was \"assuming the worst.\" She said she hadn't heard from him since Dec. 31.",

  "text": "Two local events to aid leukemia victim. Terry Chase is suffering from a rare form of leukemia and is looking to the community for help. The 60-year-old Alton man was diagnosed with leukemia in August and discovered that his form of the disease does not respond to typical cancer drugs. Instead, he requires a stem cell transplant - a procedure similar to a bone marrow transplant, except that only stem cells from the marrow are used. \"What initially seemed like a simple part of the whole thing, to find a donor, get a transplant, turned into the biggest hurdle of all of it,\" Chase said. Chase had to stop working due to chemotherapy and weekly blood transfusions. He is married with two stepchildren. Mike Guglielmo, New England ambassador for the bone marrow donor center DKMS Americas, is organizing a bone marrow drive today at the Meredith Community Center from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. A second group is conducting a drive tomorrow at Pizzeria Uno in Concord, at 15 Fort Eddy Road, from noon to 6 p.m. The Uno's drive is also a fundraiser, and 20 percent of proceeds from anyone who eats at the restaurant during that time will be given to the Chase family. Getting on the national bone marrow registry requires only a cheek swab.",

  "text": "Four homes burglarized in one week. The police are asking the public to be alert after four Hopkinton homes were burglarized during daylight hours this week. Three residences were broken into Wednesday on Farrington Corner Road, just off Jewett Road. The residents were not home at the time of the burglaries, and the thief or thieves made off with electronics and other \"household items,\" according to Hopkinton police Chief David Wheeler, who declined to detail what specific items were taken. Another house was burglarized on Elizabeth Road Thursday, again during the daytime. Wheeler said the police \"definitely\" believe the robberies are connected, and they are stepping up patrols on the town's back roads, as well as communicating with police departments in the region. Hopkinton is the latest town hit in a string of residential burglaries that have occurred over the last several weeks, which Wheeler, in part, attributed to poor economic times. The police in Hillsboro this week arrested two men for allegedly receiving stolen property, and investigators said they believe the men were likely responsible for thefts in several nearby towns. Wheeler asked people to report anything out of the ordinary and to pay special attention to their routines. \"Don't leave keys hidden outside of your homes. Make sure your homes are always locked, and if you go away for a while, call the police and let them know,\" Wheeler said. \"It's the common sense stuff. Don't make it easy for these people.\" Anyone with information about the burglaries is asked to call the Hopkinton Police Department at 746-5151, or the Concord Regional Crimeline at 226-3100.",

  "text": "A Marine laid to rest. A cold drizzle fell upon the hundreds of people who gathered to say goodbye to Cpl. Michael Ouellette yesterday. They stood among gravestones at the New Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery in Boscawen, circling the wooden casket that held Ouellette, the 28-year-old Manchester Marine killed last week in Afghanistan. They listened as Alan Ouellette spoke of how his older brother had lived - by reaching out to people - and proposed that friends and family do the same in his memory. They watched as two Marines held an American flag over the casket and began to fold it into crisp triangles, their hands in white gloves, their movements deliberate. Marines came from far away yesterday to honor Ouellette, who was a member of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force. He was killed March 22 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province of southwestern Afghanistan. Another Marine, Cpl. Anthony Williams, 21, of Pennsylvania, was killed the same day. The military hasn't disclosed additional details. Ouellette, who was buried with full military honors, earned seven commendations since joining the Marines in 2005. Afghanistan was his third deployment; he previously served two tours in Iraq. It was during the first tour that Lance Cpl. Christopher Escher came to know him. \"He was always a leader, even as a junior guy,\" Escher said yesterday, recalling the days they spent together on patrol in Anbar province. (\"Every day,\" he said, smiling and shaking his head slightly.) Ouellette became a team leader and then a squad leader, he said. \"He didn't even have to go on this deployment,\" said Escher, who came from Camp Lejeune, N.C., for the service. But \"the guys under him didn't have combat experience.\" Ouellette, he said, wanted to make sure they were taken care of. Ouellette is the 28th person from New Hampshire killed since 2003 while serving in Iraq or Afghanistan. Flags flew at half-staff across the state yesterday. Sen. Judd Gregg mentioned Ouellette on the floor of the U.S. Senate, saying that he'd spoken to Ouellette's mother, \"and of course he was an exceptional individual.\" And Gov. John Lynch came to yesterday's ceremony, standing among the mourners after taps was played. But the crowd yesterday numbered many more than officials and Marines and members of the military. Tai Ahmad, one of Ouellette's closest friends from high school, said many of their Manchester Memorial High School classmates had come to Ouellette's wake and services to pay their respects. \"He had no problems with anybody, not one person I can recall,\" Ahmad said in a conversation last week. \"He was truly, truly, truly just genuine.\" Young men lingered in small circles long after yesterday's service had ended, giving out hugs as they patted each other on the back. They waited in line to walk past Ouellette's casket, under the tarpaulin where his family stood. Alan Ouellette, the younger brother, greeted each person with a handshake and a hug. \"Thank you so much for coming,\" he told one woman as he hugged her tightly. \"I'm proud of my family. They're doing much better than I am.\"",
