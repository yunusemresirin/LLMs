    "text": "South Ossetia on edge of war. Diplomats are pushing urgent peace talks between Georgian and South Ossetian officials to avert all-out war as heavy fighting in the region killed at least a dozen yesterday. Tensions have only escalated in breakaway South Ossetia after severe violence last weekend, and show no sign of abating. The streets of the secessionist capital are reportedly abandoned and Tbilisi says the South Ossetian separatist leader has fled. In an address to the nation yesterday evening, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said he ordered a unilateral ceasefire. \u201cA few hours ago I gave an order\u0097a very painful order for a commander-in-chief to give\u0097that not a single Georgian unit, neither a police nor other unit under our control should return fire to end the very intense bombardment.\u201d \u201cWe must stop this spiral of violence.\u201d Interfax reported that Russian officials have succeeded in arranging emergency talks between Georgian and separatist officials for tomorrow. Talks scheduled for yesterday were derailed, ostensibly over a disagreement on what format the negotiations would be in. As of last night the violence was continuing, and Georgian officials denied reports that the South Ossetians had agreed to a ceasefire. Violence grew throughout week The confrontation sparked last weekend after the fiercest fighting in years left six dead. The conflict zone fell briefly quiet after that, but growing clashes have pushed the situation to the edge over the last several days. Both sides reported heavy shootouts overnight Wednesday that continued into the day. By yesterday evening, the South Ossetians counted two dead and 18 wounded. Reports put the number of Georgian dead at ten, with 50 wounded. Tbilisi says the separatists launched an attack yesterday on the Georgian-controlled villages of Nuli and Avnevi in a bid to take strategic heights overlooking the area. A Georgian armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the attacks, confirmed Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili, wounding three Georgian troops. \u201cHeavy shootings continue,\u201d he told the Messenger yesterday. The South Ossetian separatist press committee said Georgian forces attacked an Ossetian-controlled village and were pushed back from strategic hills. Late in the evening Utiashvili said that South Ossetian fighters continued to attack despite the Georgian ceasefire. The Georgian-controlled village of Prisi reportedly came under attack late last night. Separatists had claimed the day before there were Georgian artillery attacks from the heights above Prisi. Tamarasheni, a Georgian town a stone\u2019s throw from Tskhinvali, also came under fire last night, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. Accusations of preparing for war Tbilisi accuses the separatists of starting the violence. A Georgian Foreign Ministry statement yesterday said the separatists\u2019 attacks are made \u201cwith the purpose of inciting large-scale confrontation and thwarting direct dialogue.\u201d An earlier statement pointed to South Ossetian announcements of arriving volunteer fighters from the North Caucasus as further evidence they are gearing up for war. Separatist officials accuse Georgia of amassing armored vehicles and infantry near the edge of the conflict zone, and say they have evacuated women and children from Tskhinvali. They also claim Grad missile systems are set up by the Georgian town of Gori, south of the conflict zone. Eyewitnesses in the area said they saw large Georgian military convoys headed toward for the region. Utiashvili, the Interior Ministry spokesman, denied the deployment of missile systems but confirmed a \u201crotation of military forces near Gori.\u201d A Russian peacekeeper officer in South Ossetia told reporters yesterday that their forces recorded eight flyovers of Georgian warplanes and surveillance drones in the previous 24 hours. Yesterday\u2019s Georgian Foreign Ministry statement said Moscow shoulders much of the blame for the violence. \u201cThe only way that separatists manage to maintain their grip on power is through military, human and technical resources provided to them by the Russian Federation,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe recent developments have shown clearly that the position of the Russian Federation will be the decisive factor in how the process will unfold in the Tskhinvali region.\u201d Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister said the remarks were \u201cunfair\u201d and that Moscow is trying to mediate in the crisis to prevent more bloodshed. The Georgian president\u2019s speech, delivered after the Foreign Ministry statement was released, changed the tone on Russia\u2019s responsibility for the clashes: \u201cThe leaders of the [Russian] peacekeeping force told us a few hours ago they have completely lost control over the separatists\u2019 actions\u0085 We are in constant contact with the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s leadership. The Russian Foreign Ministry is trying\u0097they say they are trying, but not succeeding\u0097to get the separatists to cease fire.\u201d Georgia is Russia\u2019s \u201cnatural ally,\u201d said Saakashvili. Tbilisi urges talks after negotiations fail Georgia\u2019s top official for conflict issues, Temur Iakobashvili, told reporters that hoped-for talks fell through after he traveled to the conflict zone yesterday, where South Ossetian representatives refused to meet him. \u201cTskhinvali looked empty, as I know [separatist leader Eduard] Kokoity has left the town,\u201d Iakobashvili said, adding that Russia\u2019s own envoy was not able to reach Tskhinvali due to car troubles. Asked whether Georgian army troops could be sent into South Ossetia, Iakobashvili said: \u201cWe are doing everything to resolve the tense situation by peaceful means. However, we\u2019re always ready to protect our citizens wherever they are.\u201d Earlier in the week Tbilisi announced that direct talks were scheduled, but South Ossetian officials later said they would not participate, insisting that any negotiations must be within the Joint Control Commission format which includes Russian, North Ossetian, South Ossetian and Georgian representatives. Georgia says the Joint Control Commission is unbalanced and declared last year it would no longer take part in its meetings. Saakashvili last night called for direct talks in \u201cany kind of format.\u201d He also reiterated offers of wide autonomy for South Ossetia within Georgia, which he said Russia could oversee. Deep international concern The OSCE, EU and UN all weighed in yesterday with statements of concern over the violence, calling for an immediate halt and direct negotiations. Reuters reported that senior US State Department official Daniel Fried and the deputy Russian foreign minister had spoken and agreed to cooperate on keeping the violence from growing.",

    "text": "Border guards search for missing Latvian climbers. Border Police are searching for three Latvian mountain climbers missing for days in the mountains of Svaneti. The Latvians, aged 25, 29 and 40, are three of a fifteen-person tourist group traveling around Svaneti. The trio broke off from the group to explore the mountain of Ushba and have not been heard from since August 4. The remaining members reported the missing climbers to a Border Police checkpoint, which immediately sent out a small search group. They began searching August 5; the next day, another twenty border guards joined the search. According to a Georgian Border Police spokesperson, a one-kilometer-wide sheet of snow fell into the valley near Ushba, a 4 700-meter-tall peak known to be one of the most treacherous and inaccessible mountains in the western part of the Caucasus mountains. \u201cPersonal belongings\u0097a camera and backpacks of the missing people were found in the snow. It is likely that the tourists got buried under the same avalanche,\u201d a spokesperson said. In 2004, two well-known Georgian climbers died on Ushba while attempting an ascent via the Mishlyaev route, considered the most challenging path to the summit. Zurab Kuchava, a prominent Georgian mountaineer, explains that there is no established search and rescue organization in the region. \u201cThere are scattered groups, but actually there is no rescue service\u0097we do it on a case-by-case basis, with individual forces. A centralized rescue team needs lots of money, and this is probably not in the interest of the people who are in charge [of the country],\u201d he said in an earlier interview. The Border Police were tasked with the ad hoc rescue operation because the Latvians came to them to report the missing group. Border Police representatives say they hold out hope the missing climbers will be found alive.",

Concert Promoter. \"The Webster was the premiere movie theater in Hartford,\" Robertson said. \"It was the first air-conditioned movie theater, it was done in an Art-Deco style. When I'd walk in there, my Aunt Bea would be in the box office, my father would be running around, we could order anything we wanted, Eskimo Pies, or whatever.\" Robertson and her father, Albert H. Shulman, reopened the venue as a live-music hall in 1996, and it has hosted hundreds of concerts since, from to Gillian Welch, along with shows by the Flaming Lips, Queens of the Stone Age and many more. \"I think one of my favorite, favorite concerts was the two nights we had of Godsmack\" in 1999, Robertson said, recalling singer Sully Erna as \"one of the nicest people I could run into.\" \"The staff did a beautiful job, and it was just such a success, from start to finish,\" she said. Shulman died in 2003, and Robertson bought out her siblings to continue running the Webster. Tragedy struck the Webster last year, when booker Ben Wu disappeared while on the island of Tortola to attend the wedding of Robertson's daughter, Stephanie Decker. Wu is presumed to have drowned. Robertson, who had in the past fielded inquiries about selling the theater, said the incident helped her decide to sell if she got the right offer. Peters made the right offer. \"He is the right person for the Webster and the right person for Hartford,\" Robertson said.",

The burn ban issued for Walker County on Jan. 18 was lifted Monday following a conference between Huntsville Fire Chief Tom Grisham and Walker County Judge Danny Pierce. With the discontinuation of the burn ban, all Walker County residents will now be allowed to conduct outdoor burns. Those residents living within Huntsville city limits, however, will be required to obtain an updated burning permit from the fire department. \u201cGrisham and Pierce met today and lifted the burn ban on county, so anybody in the county is allowed to burn,\u201d said Jason January with the Huntsville Fire Department. \u201cOn the 14-day outlook, it shows us being out of immediate fire danger, and while different parts of the county have received different amounts of rain, we\u2019ve dropped an average of two hazard classes as an entire county.\u201d Residents of Huntsville will be able to pick up a burning permit \u2014 which is mandatory for city residents who plan to burn \u2014 at either of the city\u2019s fire stations, January said. \u201cWhile the burn ban has been lifted, people who live in the city will still need to come by Huntsville Fire Station 1 or 2 to obtain a new burning permit,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is necessary because all burning permits expire once a burn ban has been enacted.\u201d January said the burning permits, which are free to the public, will allow the permit holders to burn for 60 days. While the permits will negate any legal concerns for residents, January said the community is still encouraged to keep in contact with the local fire department to stay aware of any future burn bans. \u201cEven though we received some rain over the last week, we can\u2019t predict conditions for the area in the next few weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on how much rain we receive in the next few weeks, the burn ban could go back into effect.\u201d According to January, 190 of approximately 250 counties in the state are still under burn bans, but the change in soil saturation seen in Walker County has allowed the local ban to be lifted. \u201cThough we have lifted our burn ban for the time being, we still want to make sure everybody is being really careful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re thankful we\u2019re able to do this now, primarily because it allows us to clear out a lot of debris, trash and wood that has piled up since January. \u201cStill, we want people to exercise caution as we\u2019re probably going to have some controlled burns get out of control, even with this amount of rain.\u201d Walker County residents are also asked to be considerate of their neighbors while burning, as certain items to be burned may produce high amounts of smoke. \u201cWe have a definite concern with the amount of wetness in things that might be burned,\u201d January said. \u201cThings like sticks, brush and leaves are all wet right now, and when people try to light those things on fire, they\u2019re going to create a lot of smoke. \u201cWe just want everyone to think about their neighbors whenever they\u2019re burning.\u201d",

    "text": "House passes bill taxing bonuses for AIG, others. WASHINGTON \u2014 Denouncing a \u201csquandering of the people\u2019s money,\u201d lawmakers voted decisively Thursday to impose a 90 percent tax on millions of dollars in employee bonuses paid by troubled insurance giant AIG and other bailed-out companies. The House vote was 328-93. Similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate and President Barack Obama quickly signaled general support for the concept. \u201cI look forward to receiving a final product that will serve as a strong signal to the executives who run these firms that such compensation will not be tolerated,\u201d the president said in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, told colleagues, \u201cWe want our money back now for the taxpayers. It isn\u2019t that complicated.\u201d The outcome may not have been complicated. But the lopsided vote failed to reflect the contentious political battle that preceded it. Republicans took Democrats to task for rushing to tax AIG bonuses worth an estimated $165 million after the majority party stripped from last month\u2019s economic stimulus bill a provision that could have banned such payouts. \u201cThis political circus that\u2019s going on here today with this bill is not getting to the bottom of the questions of who knew what and when did they know it,\u201d said House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio. He voted \u201cno,\u201d but 85 fellow Republicans joined 243 Democrats in voting \u201cyes.\u201d It was opposed by six Democrats and 87 Republicans. The bill would impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses given to employees with family incomes above $250,000 at American International Group and other companies that have received at least $5 billion in government bailout money. It would apply to any such bonuses issued since Dec. 31. The House vote, after just 40 minutes of debate, showed how quickly Congress can act when the political will is there. It was only this past weekend that the bailed-out insurance giant paid bonuses totaling $165 million to employees, including traders in the Financial Products unit that nearly brought about AIG\u2019s collapse. AIG has received $182.5 billion in federal bailout money and is now 80 percent government owned. Disclosure of the bonuses touched off a national firestorm that both the Obama administration and Congress have scurried to contain. In a statement issued by the White House late Thursday, Obama said the House vote \u201crightly reflects the outrage that so many feel over the lavish bonuses that AIG provided its employees at the expense of the taxpayers who have kept this failed company afloat. \u201d\u201cIn the end, this is a symptom of a larger problem \u2014 a bubble-and-bust economy that valued reckless speculation over responsibility and hard work,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is what we must ultimately repair to build a lasting and widespread prosperity.\u201d Topic No. 1 raised by Republicans during the House debate was the last-minute altering of a provision in Obama\u2019s $787 billion stimulus law to cap executive compensation for firms receiving government bailouts. The measure might have forestalled payment of the AIG bonuses. But Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat and the author of the provision, says the administration insisted that he modify his proposal so that it would only apply to payments agreed to in the future. That, critics claim, cleared the way for the AIG payouts. \u201cThe idea came from the administration,\u201d Dodd said ThursdayDodd said he was not aware of any AIG bonuses at the time the change was made. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner confirmed such conversations with Dodd. He said the administration was worried about possible legal challenges to the provision. \u201cWe expressed concern about this specific version,\u201d Geithner said in an interview with CNN. \u201cBut we also worked with him to strengthen the overall bill.\u201d The treasury secretary, who has been criticized for not learning of the AIG bonus payments sooner since he helped orchestrate the bailout last year as president of the New York Fed, said anew in the interview that he was not informed of the bonuses until last week. \u201cAnd as soon as I heard about the full scale of these things, we moved very actively to explore every possible legal avenue to address this problem,\u201d Geithner said. A similar \u2014 but not as punitive \u2014 bill to recoup bonus payments with taxes was gaining support in the Senate. It would impose a 35 percent excise tax on the companies paying the bonuses and a 35 percent tax on the employees receiving them. The taxes would apply to all companies receiving government bailout money, but they are clearly geared toward AIG. \u201cThis is not just another case of runaway corporate greed and arrogance, ripping off shareholders by excesses lavished around the executive suite,\u201d said Rep. Earl Pomeroy, D-N.D. \u201cThese bonuses represent a squandering of the people\u2019s money. ... Starting right here, right now, we are saying no more.\u201d The Senate measure is sponsored by Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and the panel\u2019s senior Republican, Chuck Grassley of Iowa. It was expected to be brought to the Senate floor next week. Meanwhile, New York\u2019s attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, said AIG has given him the list of employees who received a total of $165 million in retention bonuses. Cuomo said he won\u2019t release any employees\u2019 names until his office has answered any security concerns raised by the AIG employees. He also said he will work with AIG in the coming days to determine which workers have decided to return the payments. Cuomo had sought the names from AIG chief executive Edward Liddy through a subpoena. The deadline was Thursday. About 400 AIG employees and future employees received bonuses, but not all of them earned over the $250,000 family income threshold specified by the House bill. Obama administration special envoy Richard Holbooke was on AIG\u2019s board of directors in early 2008, when the insurance company committed to the bonuses, and during the previous years of aggressive investment strategies that brought the firm to brink of collapse. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Thursday: \u201cMr. Holbrooke had nothing to do with and knew nothing about the bonuses.\u201d While the House legislation calls for a 90 percent tax, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said he expected local and state governments to take the remaining 10 percent of the bonuses. Rangel said the bill would apply to mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, among others, while excluding community banks and other smaller companies that have received less bailout money. \u201cThe American people demand protection and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing today,\u201d he told the House.",

    "text": "Past year has been \u2018best\u2019 for Dyer. The 2008 Walker County Fair Queen made one of her last official appearances Tuesday during the annual Committeeman\u2019s Barbecue at the Walker County Fairgrounds. Jordan Dyer, a 17-year-old Huntsville High School student, has spent the last year making more than 30 public appearances in Huntsville and in counties around the state as the current fair queen. Now, just days before the 2009 Walker County Fair Queen is to be crowned, Dyer is all smiles as she fulfills her final duties. \u201cThis was probably the best year I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cI probably went to about 30 or 40 events throughout the year, including all kinds of fair functions, shows and meetings. \u201cIt was a really busy year, but I knew going into it that I was going to have that much to do, and I had a great time.\u201d Dyer\u2019s favorite part of being the fair queen was working with younger participants on events like the Prince and Princess Contest. \u201cI learned a lot both while traveling around the state and while working with different groups in Walker County,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cNot only did I make friendships that will last a lifetime, but I gained leadership and communication skills as well. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how many kids would be looking up to me in this position, and I definitely had to stay on my best behavior for the entire year.\u201d With a new fair queen to be crowned Saturday, Dyer has very few remaining duties to fulfill as the current queen. \u201cIn addition to participating in the Committeeman\u2019s Barbecue, I\u2019m also going to be involved in the annual Walker County Fair Association Parade, and I\u2019ll also be part of the rehearsals for the opening ceremonies,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll be available to help the girls in this year\u2019s queen contest get ready for their events, as well. \u201cI know the girls who are competing \u2014 especially those who end up in the queen\u2019s court and the new queen herself \u2014 are going to have a great time. The whole experience was a lot of fun, and I would definitely do it again if I could.\u201d While Dyer was showing her contest heifer in Houston on the day of the 2009 queen participants\u2019 contest presentations, she said she was very impressed with the video recording of the contest. \u201cI think everybody did a really great job with their projects, and I think every one of the contestants has a really good shot at earning the crown,\u201d she said. \u201cWhoever doesn\u2019t win, I hope they continue on and participate in the contest next year. \u201cRegardless of who wins the contest, I would just want to tell that person not to take the experience for granted. I think they should just have fun with it, be really respectful to the other contestants and not be stressed out.\u201d On July 30, Dyer will turn 18, and while she previously planned to attend Stephen F. Austin University, she has considered changing her plans and applying to Sam Houston State University. Wherever she attends college, Dyer says she wants to major in nursing and participate in National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association events.",

    "text": "More bad wiring imperils troops in Iraq. WASHINGTON \u2014 The military is racing to inspect more than 90,000 U.S.-run facilities across Iraq to reduce a deadly threat troops face far off the battlefield: electrocution or shock while showering or using appliances. About one-third of the inspections so far have turned up major electrical problems, according to interviews and an internal military document obtained by The Associated Press. Half of the problems they found have since been fixed but about 65,000 facilities still need to be inspected, which could take the rest of this year. Senior Pentagon officials were on Capitol Hill this week for briefings on the findings. The work assigned to Task Force SAFE, which oversees the inspections and repairs, is aimed at preventing deaths like that of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth, 24, of Pittsburgh. He died in January 2008, one of at least three soldiers killed while showering since the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Scores more soldiers suffered shocks between September 2006 and July 2008, according to a database maintained by KBR Inc., the Houston-based contractor that oversees maintenance at most U.S. facilities in Iraq. \u201cWe got a ton of buildings we know probably aren\u2019t safe and we just don\u2019t have them done yet,\u201d said Jim Childs, an electrician the task force hired to help with the inspections. \u201cIt\u2019s Russian roulette. I cringe every time I hear of a shock.\u201d Ron Vance, who served as a sergeant in the California Army National Guard, remembers being knocked out cold in a shower building in 2004 in Taji, Iraq. He said he screamed and fell while showering, suffering burns on his back and shoulders. Another soldier who tried to pry him from the shower head also was injured. Vance, 57, of Fresno, Calif., said he\u2019s still too traumatized to shower without his wife nearby. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa. , called Task Force SAFE\u2019s findings troubling. He said the task force is doing good work but said problems should have been fixed much earlier. \u201cJust imagine getting the news that they\u2019ve done 25,000 facilities, but your son or daughter is in the 65,000 they haven\u2019t done,\u201d Casey told the AP. Last year, 94 troops stationed in Iraq, Afghanistan or other Central Command countries sought medical treatment for electric shock, according to Defense Department health data. KBR\u2019s database lists 231 electric shock incidents in the more than 89,000 facilities the company runs in Iraq, according to military records. KBR is the target of a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Maseth\u2019s family. They claim the company knew there were electrical problems in the building where he died, but didn\u2019t fix them. His mother testified last year on Capitol Hill. Army investigators have since reclassified Maseth\u2019s death as negligent homicide caused by KBR and two of its supervisors. An Army investigator said KBR failed to ensure work was done by qualified electricians and plumbers. The case is under legal review. \u201cKBR is not responsible for the electrocution deaths widely reported, including that of Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth,\u201d Heather Browne, a KBR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. KBR and another contractor, Arkel International, are the targets of a second lawsuit, filed by the family of another soldier electrocuted in Iraq, Staff Sgt. Christopher Lee Everett, 23, of Huntsville, Texas. Everett, a member of the Texas Army National Guard, was killed in September 2005 when the power washer he was using to clean a vehicle short-circuited. Task Force SAFE inspectors found many of the facilities that fall under KBR\u2019s contract have electrical problems, according to an internal military document obtained by The Associated Press. Of the 20,340 maintained by KBR and inspected so far, 6,935 failed the government inspection, the document said. When about 2,000 of the buildings with faulty work were re-inspected, the facilities passed, the document said. The Defense Contract Management Agency has accepted KBR\u2019s plans to correct the problems, according to the document the AP obtained. It said the agency will closely oversee KBR\u2019s work. Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., questioned why KBR has been allowed to continue to perform electrical work in Iraq. He said the military should take a more careful look at the electrical work in Afghanistan, too, where KBR also has a large contract for electrical work. \u201cIf they found widespread problems, the obvious question is why has there not been action to remove the contract and bring in another contractor?\u201d Dorgan said. Browne, the company spokeswoman, said KBR has cooperated with the government, performing technical inspection and providing requested information. Task Force SAFE (the acronym stands for Safety Action for Fire and Electricity) said it is making progress. The Army is tracking reports of just over two fires each day in Iraq, mostly blamed on electrical faults. But that\u2019s down from nearly five fires a day, Brig. Gen. Kurt Stein said in an e-mail to the AP. Stein said the number of electrical shocks has also been reduced. \u201cAlthough we are still seeing some electrical shocks, they tend to be minor and are often preventable,\u201d Stein said. In addition to the repairs, Stein said the military has purchased more reliable surge protectors to replace ones that had been bought in Iraq. \u201cOur hearts go out to the families of those who died or were injured from electrical shock or fire,\u201d Stein said. \u201cWe take our job to inspect, identify, repair and prevent electrical and fire incidents very seriously.\u201d Vance, the guardsman who was shocked in the shower, said the military didn\u2019t take his injuries seriously. He\u2019s since retired on partial disability from the Veterans Affairs Department for a \u201ccognitive disorder\u201d related to the incident, but he has sought additional compensation for what he describes as ongoing knee and shoulder problems for falling in the shower. \u201cI really don\u2019t think they cared. I didn\u2019t die,\u201d Vance said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a priority on their list. It was like, he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s alive. He\u2019s OK.\u201d",

    "text": "City manager seeks support for road work. Huntsville City Manager Bill Baine is currently working to gather support \u2014 both at the city level and at the county level \u2014 for an improvement project on state Highway 19. At a recent Walker County Commissioners Court meeting, the five-member court agreed to assist Baine in receiving a $2 million engineering grant with a $400,000 matching requirement. Now, Baine must take the grant before City Council, and he said he is very hopeful that the council will also be supportive of the project. \u201cThe grant we\u2019re looking at is a $2 million federal grant for economic development and hurricane mitigation,\u201d Baine said. \u201cOur justification for applying for the grant is that we want to improve Highway 19 so it can take some traffic off of Interstate 45 and around the city, especially during hurricane evacuations. \u201cReceiving this $2 million, which would be used to design of an improved 6.2-mile portion of Highway 19, would get us in line for future funding for the construction costs.\u201d According to Glenn Isbell, city engineer for the City of Huntsville, the portion of Highway 19 that would be addressed in the plan rests with Huntsville city limits and includes several major intersections. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re looking at creating an urban arterial on a portion of Highway 19 between Interstate 45 and Highway 30 that is largely undeveloped,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would involve creating a five-lane, curb and gutter section with a raised center median which would allow for left-turn movements. \u201cWe would also want to construct on- and off-ramps at the intersections of Highway 19 and state Highway 75, Bearkat Boulevard and Highway 190. With the right ramp configuration, the ramp at Bearkat Boulevard would become a major entrance into Sam Houston State University. \u201cAs well, we would also look at some possible traffic signals to control cross-over traffic, and we would also consider reducing the speed limit from 60 miles per hour to 50 in that portion of Highway 19.\u201d Including the $2 million engineering grant, Isbell said the total cost of the improvement project would be approximately $21 million. \u201cIn effect, this $2 million grant would be a down payment on the rest of the project,\u201d Baine said. \u201cThe construction project would be about $19 million total, and what we\u2019re trying to do is keep the taxpayers from paying too much, both now or during the possible construction phase. \u201cThe Commissioners Court has already agreed to pay one-third of our $400,000 matching requirement for the $2 million grant, and I anticipate that the City Council will respond favorably to assisting with that matching requirement, as well.\u201d Local considerationsThe lack of safety for current Highway 19 users is another large factor contributing to the project, Baine said. \u201cOne person a year is killed, each and ever year, on that highway,\u201d Baine said. \u201cPlus, we have about 54 crashes on that road each year which result in about 47 injuries involving some level of hospitalization. \u201cThe people getting hurt are not the old or the very young, but the middle-young, and the accidents are taking place at the times of the day when people go to school.\u201d While environmental studies, cost studies and even land acquisitions have taken place since 1968, no strong action has taken place with regard to Highway 19 until the recent county decision to provide support. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make this issue something the citizens can unite over so pressure an be put on political leaders above the city,\u201d Baine said. \u201cThe decision by the Commissioners Court to provide financial support was in many ways unprecedented, but now we have to think about working with Rep. Kevin Brady, state Rep. Lois Kolkhorst and other officials to move forward.\u201d While Baine said nothing is certain with respect to earning the grant, he said he feels earning the grant and getting a set improvement plan in place are good first steps toward eventual construction. \u201cWe can\u2019t get in line for construction funding without a design ready, and that\u2019s what this money would get us,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a design ready, and with persistence in applying for funds through a variety of different avenues, I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll be able to go farther with this than we have in the past.\u201d",

    "text": "Huntsville man taken into custody after standoff. A Huntsville man was taken into emergency mental health custody Friday afternoon after a three-hour standoff with police in a residential neighborhood. At 12:03 p.m. Walker County dispatchers received a 911 call from a residence in the 1300 block of Avenue Q in Huntsville reporting a suicidal person. The call was made by an elderly woman who reported that her 48-year-old son had locked himself in his bedroom with a rifle and ammunition and was threatening to commit suicide. Officers from the Huntsville Police Department and the Sam Houston State University Police Department responded quickly to the scene and set up a perimeter around the residence. \u201cUPD got several officers there very quickly,\u201d said Lt. Wes Altom of the HPD\u2019s Uniformed Services Division. \u201cSome of their guys were on their way back from lunch when the call came in, and they were able to get there and help us out.\u201d Along with UPD and HPD personnel, Texas Ranger Steve Jeter also responded to the scene and donned tactical gear to assist in securing the exterior of the residence as HPD officers attempted to make contact with the suspect. While officers from both departments worked to remove the suspect\u2019s mother safely from the premises, Altom was able to make contact with the suspect by phone. \u201cI made contact with him and talked with him a little bit,\u201d Altom said. \u201cContact was sporadic at first. He would hang up, then he would call back. As that was going on we called in Lt. Kevin Lunsford and Sgt. David Collins to assist.\u201d Collins, a trained crisis negotiator, was off-duty at the time of the call, but responded to the scene to establish contact with the suspect. Lunsford, who heads the HPD\u2019s Support Services Division, established a tactical command and called in the department\u2019s Special Response Team (SRT), an eight-officer tactical force specially trained to deal with crisis situations. As the SRT prepared to enter the residence, Collins worked to establish a relationship with the suspect. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to build a rapport, but you also have to establish credibility,\u201d Collins said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to do this with sincerity. I was honest with him about what to expect and what we were going to do. He said he wanted some time to think about it.\u201d While Collins continued negotiation with the suspect, the SRT entered the residence and took position outside the suspect\u2019s room, an upstairs bedroom over a carport. \u201cBasically they were outside of a locked door that was at the bottom of the stairs,\u201d Altom said. \u201cIt\u2019s a waiting game at that point. The main goal with involving SRT is to contain the suspect so that he doesn\u2019t become a danger to others.\u201d As the standoff continued, more precautions were taken to ensure contact with the suspect could be maintained. Knowing that the suspect was speaking to Collins from a cordless phone, officers were able to bring in a backup negotiation phone by running a phone chord from the SRT\u2019s van to the home\u2019s interior.Commanding officers also took precautions against possible injury, calling in specially trained tactical medics from Huntsville\u2013Walker County EMS. \u201cTactical medics are not armed, but they\u2019re trained to be close to the action and they help with any immediate need,\u201d Altom said. After nearly three hours of negotiations, at approximately 3:15 p.m., the suspect agreed to surrender himself to police. \u201cSgt. Collins got him to come down the stairs and unlock the door, and we took him into custody,\u201d Altom said. \u201cI had the opportunity to talk with him afterwards, and he was in very good spirits considering. He was just in a very bad place today, and he knows he needs to get some help.\u201d Two rifles, a lever action and a single shot shotgun, were confiscated from the residence by police. It is unclear if the suspect was in possession of both rifles during the standoff. Police declined to identify the suspect due to the sensitivity of the incident and the fact that he was not charged with a crime. After being taken into custody, he was transported to Huntsville Memorial Hospital for a mental health evaluation. \u201cAt that point it will be decided if he\u2019s going to be released or moved to a treatment facility,\u201d Altom said. After a three-hour standoff from which everyone walked away safely, the HPD command staff was pleased with the performance of their officers. \u201cThe chief was on scene and commented on the radio at the conclusion that he thought we did a very good job,\u201d Altom said. \u201cIt takes a team effort and communication to get a positive outcome and I think we did well. \u201d\u201cThe negotiations were great, and SRT took care of the takedown when the suspect was brought out,\u201d Lunsford said. \u201cIt went very smoothly.\u201d",

    "text": "Food selections abound at fair. Take a stroll around the Walker County Fairgrounds and your taste buds may start to go a little crazy. Aside from all the attractions and show competitions on slate at the 2009 Walker County Fair, there are plenty of delectable delights to choose from as well, no matter what your preference. Any regular rodeo-goer will be sure to tell you that the traditional stick foods never disappoint. It was a challenge to walk around the fairgrounds and not see at least one person chowing down on some type of tasty treat stuck on a stick. Corn dogs, as long as a man\u2019s forearm, were certainly in abundance. So were chicken on a stick, roasted corn on a stick, and Polish sausage on a stick. Another staple of fair foods, fried foods, also proved that just about anything can be delicious as long it is dipped in a vat of hot oil. South Comfort Foods features fried twinkies, fried Oreos and fried bananas. Is your mouth watering yet? How about the traditional, but always satisfying, funnel cakes topped with powered sugar, fried ice cream or fried fruit pies? These treats are sure to please, especially for those who have a bit of a sweet tooth. Speaking of which, there\u2019s certainly no shortage of cotton candy at the fair. Want to go off the beaten path a little bit and try something that may be a little unconventional as far as rodeo foods go? Then walk on over to the Greek and Italian Grill\u2019s booth for some gyros. There\u2019s also El Cabo\u2019s where you can get Mexican food like taco in a bag for just $2. For those that have trouble resisting seafood, Southern Comfort Foods also has boiled crawfish and peel-n-eat shrimp. Oh, but that\u2019s not all. There\u2019s also turkey legs that are as big as a person\u2019s head and baked potatoes, which are stuffed so much that it could easily pass for a football. What makes the wide variety of odds even better is that just about everything is affordable at around $5 or less. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of food,\u201d said Natalie Gustafson, a junior at Huntsville High School. \u201cYou get to eat and you get fat. That\u2019s all that matters. I\u2019ve been here for a long time. The rodeo is always fun. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d \u201cI really like the Italian food,\u201d added Allison Gehovak, a senior at HHS. \u201cThe turkey legs are also really good.\u201d While you\u2019re at the fair this week and you feel that grumbling in your stomach, no need to drive back into town, let your tongue have some fun and try some the savory food there at your disposable. You certainly won\u2019t regret it.",

    "text": "Scott West wins section wrestling tournament. The Scott West Panthers sealed up the Section 2AA team championship this weekend and will make their ninth trip to state later this month. Panthers roll to Section 2AA Team Championship and their 9th trip to State. After graduating eleven seniors off of last year's team that lost a Section 2AA Team showdown of top rated teams to Jackson County Central, the Scott West Wrestling team came into the 2007-08 wrestling season with a lot of questions to be answered and on this past Saturday night in Montgomery those questions would be answered as the Panthers stormed their way to a 34-14 team victory over 7th rated Watertown-ML to win the Section 2AA Team championship. \"Personally, I am more proud of this team than any other that I have been associated with as a coach over the last 20 years,\" insists Scott West wrestling coach Darren Ripley. \"They have answered the questions and overcame so much adversity throughout the year that you can't help but feel good about them as a team.\" The Scott West Wrestling team advanced to Saturday night's Section 2AA Team championship meet with a 38-19 win over Hutchinson and a 43-21 win over Delano. However, Team Panther would save their best for last as they rallied from an early ten point team deficit to knock out the Royals from Watertown-ML. \"We have a philosophy within the program that you get stronger as the day goes on,\" comments coach Ripley. \"And our kids certainly carried it out to the mat with them on Saturday night.\" After losing the first three matches to Watertown-ML's trio of good lightweights (Drew Fleming 13-1 over Lee Goldberg, Joey Stadnick 5-0 over Tyler Zilverberg and Brandon Henrich 4-0 over Jake Siegle), it was time for the Scott Wester's to call upon 125 pounder senior Tanner Adamek. \"It's Tanner time!\" exclaims coach Ripley. Adamek went right to work scoring two take downs against Drake Matuska to take a 4-1 first period lead. However, that was just a start of things to come as Adamek scored five more take downs in the second period and then six more in the third period as the Panther wrestler worked his way to a 26-11 technical fall. \"I think Tanner's win brought a lot of energy to our side,\" states coach Ripley. \"And I think it might have cast a little doubt onto the other side.\" The \"Adamek Bomb\" ignited an eight match Panther winning streak that saw Scott West build an insurmountable 28-10 lead through 171 pounds. Junior Mark Dvorak followed the Adamek win with an impressive 9-5 win over Bill McCain at 130. Dvorak opened up his offensive arsenal as he took McCain down twice in each of the first two periods with single legs and duckunders. \"Mark wrestled aggressive and smart,\" suggests coach Ripley. \"It was another big win for him and the team.\" The Panthers would get another big team win at 135 pounds as Tyler Kivel would score a 6-2 win over 6th rated Matt Hirsch. With the scored tied at 2-2 in the third period, Hirsch chose the bottom position to start the third period and that's when Kivel would go to work. The Panther junior rode the Watertown-ML wrestler hard and then cranked him over with a pair of powerful half-nelsons that accounted for two sets of near falls and the win. \"Tyler was close to finishing and scoring on some take downs and that he need to do,\" states coach Ripley. \"He certainly was dominant and tough on top in the third period to get the big win.\" Steamrolling his way to a big win for the Panthers was 140 pounder Tony Valek as the senior scored a 15-0 technical fall over a good sophomore wrestler in Max Poikonen. Valek scored from every position and would widen the gap with reversals and near falls in each of the final two periods. \"Tony is just a complete wrestler,\" sites coach Ripley. \"However, beyond being a complete wrestler, Tony is a great leader and has had a great impact on this team getting to the State Tournament.\" The big wins would keep coming for the Panthers as senior Gabe Dvorak would score a decisive 8-2 win over Jon Dailing at 152 pounds. Dvorak would take a 3-0 lead into the third period and would score a reversal to take a commanding 5-0 lead en route to the victory. \"Gabe really stepped up and wrestled well in the semi final meet against Delano and here in the championship against Watertown-ML,\" responds coach Ripley. \"He wrestled like a Scott West senior with the last name being Dvorak.\" The Dvorak win made it six wins in a row for Scott West and the Panthers would get wins seven and eight not from a Dvorak but from a pair of Fogarty's, cousins Dillon and Connor. Dillion would win a 1-0 rematch over Taylor Neaton at 160 pounds and Connor would do the same with a 4-2 rematch win over Brad Falde at 171. \"They maybe related by blood but their wrestling styles are far from related,\" contends coach Ripley. \"Dillon's going to come straight at you and wrestle you hard with six minutes of basic, fundamental wrestling, while his \"Crazy\" cousin is going take you on roller coaster ride around the mats that you can't even come close to buying at any amusement park in America.\" Watertown-ML's #1 rated Eric Reinert would put an end to the Scott West winning streak as he would down Michael Kroell's at 189 pounds by a score of 16-3. Kroell's, just an 8th grader, put up a good fight and made the Royal wrestler earn his points. \"Michael did a good job of making Reinert earn his points,\" states coach Ripley. \"It's all part of the process and I think some day soon Scott West fans will see Michael Kroells doing the same thing to many of his opponents.\" Senior Alex Krautkremer has been through the process and the Panther wrestler got after Royal wrestler Nate Dickhausen in their third meeting of the year at 215. With the two wrestlers splitting a pair of matches throughout the year, Krautkremer would score early in often in this one as he widened the gap between the two wrestlers by following up a take down with a half nelson that sent Dickhausen to his back, a three-point near fall and an eventual 11-4 Krautkremer win. \"We would have really liked to seen Alex get the pin or the major,\" insists coach Ripley. \"However, this was a very good match for him and it does show that he has been practicing and wrestling well.\" Just a sophomore, Panther heavyweight Travis Hentges has also been wrestling well. Hentges would close out the meet with a solid 6-2 win over Derek Ernst as he used a take down in each of the three periods to win. \"Travis was close to getting some turns and we would have really liked to see that,\" states coach Ripley. \"With that being said, we have really liked the way that Travis has wrestled since the middle of January on.\" Following the Hentges win at heavyweight, the Scott West captains were presented the Section 2AA Team Championship plaque, the enthusiastic Scott West fans flooded the Montgomery gym floor as the State Celebration was on and an echo went throughout all of Scott County: \"We are...SCOTT WEST! ...We are...SCOTT WEST! ...We are...SCOTT WEST!\" Scott West will take to the mats at the St. Paul XCEL Energy Center on Thursday night (February 28th) at 5:00 p.m. with a 27-5 dual meet record this season. The Panthers will face Plainview-Elgin Millville, a team that they beat 45-23 at this year's Clash VI--National Duals in Rochester. \"I don't put too much stock in last time meetings,\" comments coach Ripley. \"There are a lot of variables in high school wrestling and things change, line ups change and you just better have 14 guys that come ready to wrestle if you want to advance to the next round.\" Before the Scott West Wrestling team takes to the mats for their 9th trip to the State Tournament in its 18 year wrestling history, the Panthers will make their way to Delano this weekend for the Section 2AA Individual Tournament with the top two wrestlers in each of the 14 weight classes advancing on to the State Tournament. \"There won't be any free passes,\" states coach Ripley. \"Section 2AA has a long standing history and reputation over the last several years as arguably being the toughest Section in the State, regardless of class.\" The Section 2AA Individual Tournament in Delano will begin with wrestling action at 4:30 p.m. on Friday and at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday. See you at the mat and Go Panthers! Congrats to the team for a group effort. Good luck at the individual tournament this weekend!",

    "text": "Ripley's account of Panthers at Belle Plaine. The Scott West wrestling team upped their record to 24-5 in Belle Plaine on Friday night as the Panthers closed out their regular season of wrestling with a 30-21 win over Minnesota's #7 rated team in Class AA, the Watertown-Mayer Lutheran Royals. \"It was a Royal Battle!\" exclaims Scott West Wrestling coach Darren Ripley. With both teams in Section 2AA, the win will most likely give Scott West the number 1 seed heading into this week's Section 2AA Team Tournament that will be held in Montgomery. \"It was a hard fought meet by both teams and we got a good team effort,\" states coach Ripley. \"The #1 is seed is what we wrestled for tonight,\" claims coach Ripley. \"However, a seed does not put you in the State Tournament and that's what we will be wrestling for next week.\" The \"Royal Battle\" would begin with three battles in the lightweight divisions of 103, 112 and 119. Watertown-Mayer Lutheran would come out on the winning end of all three low scoring matches as the Royals got a win from #3 rated Drew Fleming at 103 as he scored a late, third period reversal to win 4-2 over #4 rated Panther Lee Goldberg. The Fleming win was followed by a 2-1 Joey Stadnick win at 112 as the #7 rated Royal wrestler made a first period take down stand up over Panther Tyler Zilverberg. Tenth-rated Brandon Henrich would make it a sweep of the first three weight classes for the visiting Royals as the 119 pounder held on to a 4-2 win over Jake Siegle. \"We knew coming into the meet that there were going to be several close, hard fought matches,\" insists coach Ripley. \"The fight was on!\" After Drake Matuska gave the Royals a 15-0 team lead by pinning Francis Dvorak in the first period at 125, Mark Dvorak would break the scoring ice for the Panthers as he scored a dramatic 5-4 victory over Bill McCain at 130. Trailing 4-3 with just seven seconds left in the match, Dvorak switched McCain for a match winning reversal that gave the Panthers their first three team points of the meet. \"We needed somebody to break the ice,\" comments coach Ripley. \"I would say that is Mark's biggest win for the team since his 8th grade year when he picked up a couple of big team wins over STMA and Milaca.\" The Dvorak win at 152 gave Scott West its first team lead at 18-15 and Dillon Fogarty would close out the Panther six match winning streak pretty much in the same manner as it had started. Trailing Watertown's Taylor Neaton 2-0 late in the match, Fogarty would be awarded one point for a stalling call and then would reverse the Royal wrestler with less than five seconds remaining in the match to get a 3-2 win at 160. \"We always stress that you have to wrestle six minutes and that you have to score the last points of the period,\" states coach Ripley. \"Fortunately, we were able to do that a couple of times tonight.\" The Royals would come back to tie the team score (21-21) at 171 as #1 rated Eric Reinert would score a third period pin of Kyle McDermand. However, the Panthers would come back to win the last three matches of the meet and secure the 30-21 team win behind Connor Fogarty's 4-0 win over Brad Falde at 189, Alex Krautkremer's 3-2 win over Nate Dickhausen at 215 and Travis Hentges 4-0 win over Derek Ernst at heavyweight. \"Again, all three wrestlers stayed in good position and made points hard to come by,\" states coach Ripley. \"Krautkremer's win was especially big because Dickhausen had defeated him earlier at the Christmas Tournament and it gave us an insurmountable six point team lead in this meet.\"",

    "text": "Outrage mixes with mourning as three of four victims in Raytown homicide are buried . But instead the two Clemons boys, ages 10 and 7, were snuggled side by side in a casket. Despite it being a perfectly lovely casket \u2014 bright white, gold trim and red roses at their feet \u2014 this was a heartbreaking sight. Gerard came up shorter, just like on the basketball court. He was only a first-grader, but he had played up so he could be on the same team as his big brother. U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, who spoke at Monday\u2019s funeral for the brothers and their aunt, Precious Triplett, said he didn\u2019t want to hear any talk of the murders being part of God\u2019s plan or that the victims were now in a better place. \u201cGod had nothing to do with this!\u201d railed Cleaver, who is a co-pastor of St. James United Methodist Church, where the service was held. Cleaver called the killer an animal and asked that anyone who knew something to step forward and tell police. \u201cIf a hyena was running around the neighborhood, everyone would call animal control,\u201d Cleaver told the full church. And then he yelled: \u201cThis was not supposed to happen!\u201d The bodies of Amir and Gerard, their 21-year-old aunt and her boyfriend, Andre Jones Sr., 33, were found March 16 in a Raytown apartment. The boys had arrived the night before to spend the night. No arrests have been made in the quadruple homicide. The investigation initially was handled by the Metro Squad but has been turned over to Raytown police, who on Monday made no statement on the case. Detectives have not said when the killings occurred or how the victims died. The boys\u2019 father found the bodies March 16 when he went to the apartment. Triplett was remembered Monday as a young mother who worked hard to improve her life and that of her son. She wanted to become a nurse and worked at a restaurant. Memories of the Clemons brothers were mostly about basketball. They played on a Missouri Valley Blazers fourth-grade team. The team will retire both their numbers. Ten-year-old Amir was a team leader, a high scorer and the quieter of the two. On March 13, he scored 26 points against a team of older players. \u201cHe was really hot, so I kept giving him the ball, and he kept making them,\u201d a teammate said in a video played during the service, a tear running down his cheek. \u201cHe was really fun to play with, and I wish I had him back.\u201d Gerard \u2014 he went by the nickname \u201cLittle G\u201d \u2014 was more of a talker, aggressive, always ready to shoot a three-pointer. He made his teammates laugh. \u201cHe was great in practice until it was time to run laps,\u201d said coach James Price. \u201cThen Gerard would usually need to go get a drink or talk to his mother.\u201d And Little G always used to ask Price whether he could be in the starting lineup. Price will do the best he can to grant that request when the Blazers take the court Friday night. The team will start the game with only three players.",

He found the men early Saturday in Independence, but during an ensuing struggle, the 48-year-old Kansas City man was fatally stabbed in the back. Jackson County prosecutors charged an Independence teenager on Monday with killing Welch and another teen with the stealing that led to Saturday\u2019s fatal confrontation. According to court documents, Welch went to a residence in the 300 block of East Elm Street about 1:45 a.m. Saturday and got into a fight with 19-year-old Anthony Gillen of Kansas City. While they were struggling, 18-year-old Christopher Vasquez allegedly stabbed Welch. Welch and Gillen\u2019s mother, who had accompanied him to the residence, then left in a pickup truck but pulled over near Interstate 435 and 23rd Street and called 911. Gillen and Vasquez were picked up for questioning on Saturday afternoon. Vasquez admitted to police that he and Gillen had stolen property from Welch and that he had stabbed Welch, according to court documents. Gillen told detectives that he was on the ground struggling with Welch when he saw Vasquez approach. Welch then \u201cseemed to lose power and stop fighting.\u201d After Welch and his mother left, Gillen said Vasquez told him that he had stabbed Welch and needed to get rid of the knife. Vasquez later led detectives to where he had hidden the knife and it was recovered, according to the documents. He is charged with second-degree murder and armed criminal action and Gillen is facing a felony stealing charge.",

Attorneys for Linda Rinehart, who appeared in Cass County Circuit Court, also filed a motion to prohibit cameras in the courtroom during pretrial proceedings. Her husband, Danial Rinehart, is accused of having an incestuous relationship with one of the couple\u2019s teenage daughters that lasted five years and produced four babies. He has been charged with second-degree murder, incest, statutory rape, child endangerment and abandonment of a corpse. Authorities say Linda Rinehart knew of the abuse but did nothing to stop it. She is next due in court May 11. One of the babies survived. The boy is in state custody. A firefighter stopped a woman from stealing a battalion chief\u2019s marked vehicle from a fire station about 7:30 p.m. Sunday. After the woman entered the station\u2019s open doors at 1517 Locust Street, a firefighter in the back of the garage told her she was not supposed to be there. The woman jumped into a Fire Department sport utility vehicle and turned the keys in the ignition. The firefighter hopped in the passenger side, turned off the ignition and detained the 24-year-old woman. Police later arrested her. A man has been charged for the role he allegedly played in a car chase in which a Kansas City, Kan., police officer was dragged about 50 feet. Issac Fisher, 26, of Kansas City, Kan., was charged Monday in Wyandotte County District Court with aggravated battery, felony eluding a police officer, disorderly conduct and obstructing the legal process. Fisher was one of three people police arrested Thursday night after a 10-minute car chase that began in Kansas City, Kan., when a police officer was dragged by Fisher\u2019s vehicle, a news release from District Attorney Jerome A. Gorman said. The officer shot the driver of the car, who was caught in the area of Roanoke Park in Kansas City. Police have identified a man who was killed in a shooting early Saturday. Johnny L.

Mihm pleaded guilty in Jackson County Circuit Court to a charge of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Steven W. Keith. As part of the plea agreement, a separate case involving a charge of leaving the scene of an accident was dismissed, according to a court spokesman. Sentencing is scheduled May 7. Keith, 51, of Blue Springs, worked for a private company and was escorting a procession April 2 on Woods Chapel Road near Castle Drive when his motorcycle and the sport utility vehicle driven by Mihm collided, according to police reports and court documents. Witnesses said Mihm had been weaving in and out of the procession in an attempt to get ahead of it when the collision occurred.",

The two-alarm blaze at the Sunny Hills Apartments & Town Homes was reported just after 9 a.m. as a deck fire in the 1600 block of Northeast Club House Drive. By the time firefighters arrived, one building with about eight units was engulfed in flame. Rose, 28, his 2 1/2-year-old son and his fiancee made it safely outside. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my neighbor, I probably would have died of smoke inhalation,\u201d said Rose, who works the overnight shift at a Northland packing facility. \u201cI have to be around for my son,\u201d he said. The wind-fanned fire quickly spread to the second apartment building, where Rose lived. Fire crews from North Kansas City and Kansas City used aerial hoses to pour water on the blaze. The thick, black smoke was visible for miles along Interstate 35. Fire officials did not know how many residents were displaced. Investigators are expected to spend today picking through debris to determine how the fire started. The high winds made for difficult work for the fire crews, said North Kansas City Fire Marshal David Dollins. Two firefighters reported minor injuries, but fire officials knew of no injuries among residents.",

    "text": "Henderson, Boulder City to weigh police, fire facility. The Boulder City Council on Tuesday will consider continuing plans to build a public safety training facility for police and firefighters in the Eldorado Valley. If the council approves a memorandum of understanding with Henderson, the cities will move forward with joint development of the 720-acre training grounds, a project nearly 10 years in the works. Henderson has $1 million set aside for the $6 million project, said Keith Paul, a spokesman for the Henderson Police Department. The agreement wouldn't place any timelines for construction, but it would mean the cities would continue looking for funding in future appropriation bills, Boulder City Manager Vicki Mayes said. \"It's the first step in the process,\" she said. In 2007, Boulder City dedicated $150,000 for the master plan of the training grounds to be built near Silver State Materials off U.S. 95, just north of the dry lake bed, Mayes said. At the council meeting, Poggemeyer Design Group will present that master plan. The facility would have pistol, rifle and shotgun ranges, repelling towers, and a track for emergency vehicle operators to train, Boulder City Police Chief Thomas Finn said. Boulder City and Henderson would allow other police and fire agencies to use the facility for a fee, he said. Mayes said $600,000 for the project recently was recently approved through the Legislature's omnibus bill. Finn said pairing with Henderson on the project is ideal. \"Henderson has money and we have land,\" he said. \"It's a perfect location because it will probably be surrounded some day by solar energy plants, never homes and businesses, so no one will ever complain about the shooting ranges.\"",

    "text": "Police shooting in North Las Vegas ruled justifiable. A coroner's inquest ruled today that the fatal police shooting of Tyrise M. Bell on Jan. 23 in North Las Vegas was justified. North Las Vegas Police Officer Michael Eggers shot Bell as the two struggled over a 9mm Beretta handgun Bell pulled from inside his pants. The deadly confrontation between Bell and Eggers came at the end of a foot chase after Bell ran from the officer near the intersection of Revere Street and Ann Road. Eggers, dressed in full police uniform and driving a marked police car with overhead lights activated, tried to stop Bell and another man for jaywalking. The other man has not been identified. The men ran in opposite directions and the other officer chased Bell. Bell ran through two business parking lots and jumped two walls before turning on the officer and striking him in the face with his fist, according to testimony at the inquest. Eggers tackled Bell and a violent fight ensued that tired both men, already exhausted after a run of more than 100 yards. Bell removed a handgun from his pants as Eggers tried to get hold of Bell's hands in the darkness. Feeling the gun, Officer Eggers grabbed it by the top front, just over the barrel. The two fought for control of the weapon before Eggers, beginning to fear he would lose the fight and his life, drew his own gun. Officer Eggers gave commands for Bell to let go of the gun, pressed his own weapon into Bell's back and when that did not stop Bell, Eggers fired five shots, four of which struck Bell. Eggers said he fired until he felt Bell's hand on the gun go limp. Eggers had 16 months experience with the North Las Vegas Police Department at the time of the shooting and, prior to that, five years' experience as a Las Vegas City Marshal.",

    "text": "Man recovers after 'killer bee' attack in Silverado Ranch area. A 53-year-old man remained hospitalized Sunday, a day after being stung \"a couple thousand times\" in what authorities are calling the worst bee attack around Las Vegas in 20 years. The man accidentally disturbed a nest of Africanized honey bees, also known as \"killer bees,\" when he overturned a boulder while operating a backhoe, Clark County Fire Department spokesman Scott Allison said Sunday. The incident happened in a Silverado Ranch neighborhood near Spencer Street and Eldorado Lane. He was listed in stable condition Sunday in the intensive care unit at St. Rose Dominican Hospital-Siena campus, hospital spokeswoman Kim Haley said. Haley said the man was stung a couple thousand times, and it was uncertain how long he would have to remain hospitalized. The man was stung on his face, arms, neck and back, Allison said, and firefighters sprayed bees off him with a hose. \"There were so many that they couldn't see the skin on his back when they got to him,\" he told The Associated Press. \"They said it was a black mass of bees on his back continuing to sting him. \"One of the vector control guys with the county said it was the biggest hive he had ever seen. He guessed it weighed about 50 pounds,\" he added. While not native to the U.S., killer bees are well established in southern Nevada. In 2000, a 77-year-old Las Vegas woman was stung about 500 times and survived. In 2003, a horse in Pahrump was killed after being attacked. \"I've been on the department for 20 years and don't remember an attack this bad,\" Allison said. \" (Responders) told me it was like something out of a horror movie.\" Experts urge people under attack to run as fast as possible, saying it's possible to outrun bees if one can run fast and far enough. They also urge people not to jump in swimming pools, saying bees can see people and wait for them there.",

The land took seven years to assemble and is zoned for a 28-story, 2,200-room hotel with 500,000 square feet of gaming, restaurant, entertainment and meeting space, according to a press release issued by Chartwell Group, which is overseeing the auction.

Berland, executive vice president and principal of Chartwell Group\u2019s Accelerated Marketing Division, said in a statement. Bidding will start at $27.5 million. The Dragon City resort is one of multiple proposals for Asian-themed casinos in Las Vegas that have not come to fruition. Even before the recession, financing for off-Strip casinos by industry newcomers was difficult at best.

That number is less that the national and state average, but it is a 6 percent increase from January. According to information released Friday by the Indiana Department of Workforce Development, Boone County\u2019s unemployment rose from 7.3 percent in January to 7.7 in February. State unemployment was 9.4 percent in February and the national rate for that month was 8.1 percent. Boone County\u2019s rate places it in the middle of surrounding counties. According to Bureau of Labor Statists data, neighboring counties and their rates include: Hamilton, 6 percent; Hendricks, 7.3 percent; Marion, 8.7 percent; Montgomery County, 9.1 percent, and Clinton, 10.5 percent. Boone County has a workforce of 27,733 and in February, 25,588 individuals were employed, compared to 2,145 out of work. At 7.7 percent unemployment, Boone County\u2019s figure is near the middle of Indiana counties \u2014 it was 42nd of the state\u2019s 92 counties. An overview of the stateIndiana\u2019s unemployment rate grew slightly in February to 9.4 percent, keeping the state\u2019s jobless rate at the highest level since the recession of the early 1980s. February\u2019s jobless report shows 324,000 Indiana residents looking for work \u2014 about 4,000 more than in January. That pushed the state\u2019s jobless rate up slightly from January\u2019s 9.3 percent. February\u2019s numbers suggest that an increase in heavy construction jobs amid the lingering recession is starting to offset continued drops in auto manufacturing, said Teresa Voors, commissioner of the Indiana Department of Workforce Development. \u201cWe expect to see continued growth as outdoor construction resumes, but this may not completely negate extended furloughs and layoffs in the automobile industry in the coming months,\u201d Voors said. Indiana\u2019s 0.1 percentage-point February jobless increase was the smallest among it and neighboring states. Illinois reported the largest increase, up 0.8 points to 8.6 percent. Ohio\u2019s rose 0.6 points to 9.4 percent, while Kentucky\u2019s climbed 0.5 points to 9.2 percent. Michigan\u2019s rate climbed 0.4 points to 12.0 percent.

In February last year, the Lebanese government said it would give all foreigners, including Iraqi refugees, who stayed in the country after their visas expired, a three-month period during which they could legalize their status. But it remains unclear exactly how many Iraqis regulated their status during that time. BEIRUT: The body of an Iraqi national was discovered on Saturday, a police report said. Mohammad Abed al-Wahab, born in 1952, was found dead in the town of Maameltein, Keserwan. The cause of death has not yet been confirmed, but a forensics team is investigating.",

BEIRUT: Israel deliberately flooded Lebanese farmlands with excess rainwater from an Israeli orchard, located off the southern town of Mais al-Jabal early Tuesday, ruining crops and properties, the state-run national news agency said. The Lebanese Army and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) dispatched teams to look into the incident, which drew protests from the southern residents. Tuesday's flooding is part of a systematic practice by the Israeli authorities to turn the highly-fertile land into swamps by channeling rainwater into the fields via trenches, which were dug for that purpose. The Lebanese Army and UNIFIL have tried to block the water channels to protect the crops. Separately, UNIFIL's media coordinator, Dhalia Farran, reiterated calls for Israel to hand over official maps detailing where the Israeli army dropped cluster bombs during the summer 2006 war.",

    "text": "AMEL center offers breathing space to Iraqi refugees . One of the first projects the committee hopes to start is the production of an information pack that contains advice and information useful to the refugee community. Once compiled, they hope to distribute this leaflet to some of the estimated 40,000 Iraqi refugees and many other refugees from Ethiopia, the Philippines, Sudan and Syria, who are not currently registered with the UNHCR. BEIRUT: \"You know, the life of a refugee in Lebanon is such a difficult one,\" explains Haidar. \"We are treated as undesirables, as trouble-makers, even as terrorists. Society is hostile toward us and the authorities don't recognize us as equals; we suffer from abuse, exploitation and the constant fear of arrest.\" The association believes that one of the primary benefits of the center is that it provides refugees with an opportunity to participate directly in the running of the services provided by the NGO. This participatory approach relies on a commitment to allowing refugees to take direct responsibility for the provision and maintenance of services. This week, AMEL took steps in realizing this vision, by organizing a democratic vote to elect a Youth Committee to represent the interests of the NGO's six hundred plus beneficiaries, the first of its kind in Lebanon. He goes on to say that even those refugees who are registered with the UNHCR and possesses UN papers are not safe, seeing as the Lebanese authorities do not recognize the status of refugees and will arrest and detain anyone who is caught. As a result, Sajed concludes, \"many refugees cannot travel, but must remain in or close to their homes in [Beirut's southern suburbs], where the local security forces are sympathetic to their situation.\" The committee hopes that by becoming elected representatives, they can help to break the sense of isolation felt by refugees. Sajed explains the importance of the AMEL center as a safe space where people can meet and relax. \"It is a place where we are able to do the sorts of everyday things that, as refugees, we are normally deprived of.\" Committee members all agree that it is through being at the center, making friends, sharing experiences, offering and asking for advice and engaging in dynamic activities that people are able to stop thinking about themselves as refugees and start to live more normal lives. A combination of this community-based mentality and a participatory approach can be seen in action through the educational and vocational training programs provided by the AMEL center. Instead of recruiting staff from outside, the center aims to recruit trainers and teachers directly from the Iraqi refugee community. For example, one of the committee members, Sajed, a long-term refugee in Lebanon, works at the center as an Arabic literacy and history teacher. Sajed hopes that by reaching out to the community, they will find other people with skills who are willing to share them. This way, Sajed hopes, the community will be able to provide for its own needs rather than being reliant on external help.",

Chebel Rahme insisted that his appreciation stems from many things that his mother Nawal continues to do daily to show her care and love for him, but added that he also recognizes how much she sacrificed of her own comfort in life, \"to make us happy, to make us comfortable,\" especially during hard times. When asked what gift he would like to give her, Rahme paused and said, \"I want to give back to her in my lifetime as much as she gave to me in hers.\" To cater to an increased demand for greater variety in gift choices, Theirry's featured new collections of gifts this year, including themed items from aprons, gloves, and slippers to fancy vases and flowers - all with the 2009 color scheme of pink and white for the holiday. As a non-native of Lebanon, one might ask what makes mothers the object of so much ardent affection on this annual holiday. Mawla thinks it's because \"she is more close to her children compared to mothers in other countries because she spends more time with them.\" Many appreciated the strength their mothers showed during their childhoods, especially those who grew up during the 1975-1990 Civil War. \"The way she took care of us and protected us during the Civil War was amazing ... she made us feel there was nothing to be scared of. When I was little she would hug me when they were bombing and tell me it was just a game ... and that when I grew up Lebanon would be a better country,\" said Ahmed Hamade about his mother, Fatima. Others cited their mother's constant and vocal concern with their well-being as the cornerstone of their appreciation. Maria Hrawi said she loves her mother Eliana for \"always being there when I need her ... I know I'm always in her thoughts and I never feel alone.\"",

To earn the Eagle Scout rank, the highest advancement rank in Scouting, a Boy Scout must fulfill requirements in the areas of leadership, service and outdoor skills. They must earn at least 21 merit badges, and must also demonstrate leadership skills by holding one or more positions of responsibility in the troop at each rank. Another step on the road to Eagle was to plan, develop and carry out a service project. Hyland, son of Susan and William Hyland, led a service project to build picnic tables and park benches in strategic locations along the Bouman-Stickney interpretive trail loop at the Farmstead Museum in Readington Township. Patrick worked with the Readington Township Open Space Committee to identify requirements, research design and construction options, estimate costs and prepare a project plan. The project was funded through grant money awarded to the township by the Federal Highway Administration. Patrick is a senior at Hunterdon Central Regional High School.",

Maira said she had spoken with planning consultant Frank Banish and had been advised that pools had not been included as an accessory use when the area was zoned about 10 years ago because the plan at the time had called for high-density condominiums, not the single family homes that were eventually built. Cimei said the ordinance amending the regulations would be considered by the council next month, but would have to be referred to the Planning Board before it can be fully adopted. The timeline may take final adoption well into May, further delaying potential pool construction. Depending on when the work can be done, the five hopeful residents may have to wait well into the summer months before realizing the cooling effect of their swimming pools.",

However, the ordinance does state that any applicant must show all taxes, fees, fines, and all other outstanding financial obligations to the township have been paid. Furthermore, no permit will be issued to a landlord if there are outstanding governmental, zoning, construction, or fire code violations against the person or the property in question. An application for the permit must be received by the township clerk at least 45 days prior to the event and is subject to review by the township police chief, fire official, health officer, zoning officer, construction officer, and township engineer for compliance with ordinances, laws, requirements, and regulations. The applicant would require additional approvals or permits from regulatory and government agencies where jurisdiction applies, such as the N.J. Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control or the state Department of Environmental Protection. According to the ordinance, the township, the Board of Education, and township volunteer emergency services may request a waiver from the township administrator from the requirements of the permit if they are sponsoring an event. . - The Township Committee introduced an ordinance on special events permits last Tuesday, March 10, that states a non-fee permit must be obtained for any event with 50 or more people on public or private property. However, private parties, celebrations, and gatherings that take place on private property and are invitation-only will be exempt from the permit requirement. The designated number of people includes participants, spectators, employees, caterers, and anyone else present at the event. The hours of operation for all special events will be from 9 a.m. until 11 p.m.The public hearing on the ordinance is scheduled for Tuesday, April 14.",

With her stunning red hair flaming, Rebecca Mays cozily sat on her papaw\u2019s lap Saturday night, listening to Kentucky\u2019s top politicos make rousing speeches at the Lincoln Day Dinner. But soon it was her grandfather\u2019s own turn to take to the stage. And when Laurel County Clerk Dean Johnson was inducted into the 5th District\u2019s Lincoln Club Hall of Fame, he beamed at his smiling granddaughter. Johnson was one of four inductees \u2014 and the only Laurel County resident \u2014 welcomed into the prestigious club Saturday. \u201cI feel good about it, naturally,\u201d he said of the honor. Johnson joins fellow inductees state Sen. Tom Jensen, R-London; former commonwealth\u2019s attorney Tom Handy and former senator Gene Huff. But Johnson said he wasn\u2019t sure what clinched the honor for him. \u201cI really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to help and support the people who run for state and federal offices. I suppose it\u2019s because I\u2019ve tried to be a strong supporter.\u201d Johnson entered the political arena himself in the early 1970s when he ran for sheriff at the age of 31. \u201cI thought there was some room for some younger people,\u201d he said. Though he was defeated by 9 votes, Johnson was immediately hooked to the political game and, soon thereafter, made a bid to fill the county clerk seat. Again, he was narrowly defeated but not discouraged. In 1985, he won the clerk\u2019s seat and has occupied it ever since. Through it all, he has been a staunch Republican supporter, voting for Republican presidents and governors ever since he cast his first vote for Richard Nixon in 1960 at the age of 18. Johnson said he\u2019s admired many Republican presidents in his lifetime, including Dwight Eisenhower. \u201cHe was the greatest and the best we ever had,\u201d he said. \u201cI was about 10 and we studied about him. I think he did a lot to bring this nation into the modern era.\u201d Since, Johnson said he has been a fan of Ronald Reagan and \u201cbelieve it or not, I thought the Bushes did a fine job. \u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand the conditions they\u2019re serving under,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have to look at the times before we can be critical of anyone.\u201d Of Saturday\u2019s dinner, Johnson said he enjoyed speeches given by Senate President David Williams, U.S. Rep. Harold \u201cHal\u201d Rogers and U.S. Sens. Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning. \u201cI thought the content of them was good,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get into specifics about a contested race that they might have in the primary. I thought they limited their speech to what they were doing and what they want to see done.\u201d In terms of the future of the Republican party, Johnson is optimistic. \u201cI think they have to sit back and wait,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be situations they can take advantage of. I think in two years, there will be a reversal. I think people will want conservative values back.\u201d",

    "text": "Montana airplane crash victims had Laurel ties. Four of the 14 passengers who died in an airline crash in Montana Sunday had ties to Laurel County. Brent Ching, his wife Kristen and his children, Hailey, 6, and Caleb, 4, all of whom died in the crash, were related to the late Dr. Caleb Chu, who worked as a physician at Oneida Mountain Hospital for more than 30 years. Brent Ching was Chu\u2019s grandson. Chu\u2019s widow and Ching\u2019s stepgrandmother, Priscilla, has lived in London for more than 30 years. Priscilla Chu said the family was flying from Oroville, Calif., to Montana for a ski trip. Chu said the Chings were avid skiers. \u201cEven the little ones skied,\u201d she said. Chu said she heard about what happened while watching the news on TV. \u201cWhen they mentioned Oroville, it clicked,\u201d she said. Brent Ching, a dentist, was the son of Phyllis Chu, Caleb Chu\u2019s daughter. While Phyllis Chu was raised in Clay County, Ching grew up in California. His uncle Perry Chu, who attended Laurel County High School, also lives out west. Priscilla Chu said she spoke to Perry, an anesthesiologist, Sunday. \u201cHe was in bad shape and was in shock,\u201d she said. As to how she felt, Priscilla Chu just answered, \u201cHow would you feel?\u201d Chu visited the Ching family in August and said the kids were a joy. \u201cThey were so young, they loved everybody,\u201d she said. Seven of the 14 killed in the crash were believed to be children who ranged in age from 1 to 9. Around 11:30 a.m. Sunday, the plane was headed to Bozeman, Mont., but rerouted suddenly to Butte. The PC-12, which was built in 2001, nose-dived into Holy Cross Cemetery, just 500 feet short of the runway at Butte\u2019s Bert Mooney Airport. Reports Tuesday showed ice might have been a factor in the crash. There were no survivors. Staff writer Tara Kaprowy can be reached by e-mail at tkaprowy@sentinel-echo.com.",

Last day of school for Laurel County students scheduled for June 5; graduation set June 6 if state approves The last day of school for Laurel County School District students will be June 5 and graduation will be June 6, pending approval from the Kentucky Department of Education. Director of Pupil Personnel Rhonda Welch said the district will ask the Kentucky Department of Education to forgive one of its 13 missed school days this year, which will allow the June 5 end date. \u201cWe can apply for one day,\u201d Welch said. \u201cThe lady at KDE said the same thing.\u201d The rest of the missed days that were not covered under banked time will be made up. The last day of school was originally scheduled for May 27. Welch said muddling through the details of House Bill 322, which allows districts to apply for missed days, hasn\u2019t been easy. \u201cDeveloping the amended calendar this year has been somewhat of an adventure,\u201d she admitted. Welch said the commissioner has 10 days to respond to the request. If it is denied, Superintendent David Young said going to school on Memorial Day is an option. \u201cThat\u2019s the only day we can take,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we did lose another day, it gives us another option, but still keep graduation June 6.\u201d Motion was approved by Joe Schenkenfelder, seconded by Bud Stuber and unanimously approved. Following the motion, Hacker Brothers Construction Manager David Jackson told School Board members Phase I of the North Laurel High School renovation \u2014 which involves replacing the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems this summer \u2014 will be \u201cseverely affected\u201d by the calendar change. Business Manager Jim Kennedy said he would speak with Jackson and Superintendent David Young to arrive at some type of arrangement. In other action, School Board members: Approved design development drawings for Phase II of North Laurel High School. The multi-million dollar renovations to the school will involve adding four classrooms to its northwest corner, upgrading bathrooms, fixing the roof, replacing the ceiling in the auditorium, fixing doors leading to the gym and enclosing the front canopy. Motion was made by Tommy Smith, seconded by Eddie Jones and unanimously approved. Authorized the sale of four buses after declaring a school bus surplus. \u201cThis is continuing to keep us on a rotation schedule to basically replace the fleet every 14 years,\u201d Young said. Motion was made by Schenkenfelder, seconded by Stuber and unanimously approved. Tabled Cold Hill Elementary\u2019s request to get a debit/credit card machine installed at the school. Board members are waiting to get more information as to how much the machine will cost the district. Motion was made by Jones, seconded by Smith and unanimously approved. Approved the $6,897 teacher preparation program grant from the Kentucky Workforce Development Cabinet. The purpose of the grant is to provide professional development for high school teachers who are interested in teaching a Principals in Teaching class. The class will introduce students to teaching as a profession. Motion was made by Jones, seconded by Smith and unanimously approved. Approved a contract with Bluegrass Technology, which provides technical devices for students with disabilities. Motion was made by Stuber, seconded by Schenkenfelder and unanimously approved. Modified its agreement with the Lake Cumberland Area Development District for the Summer Youth Program. Deputy Superintendent Greg Smith said changing the agreement is \u201claying the groundwork\u201d so the county can accept federal stimulus money, which is expected to flow into the program.

Local cleanup activities are being organized by Laurel County PRIDE coordinator Jim Ed McDaniel and London PRIDE coordinator Steve Edge. \u201cPRIDE wants you,\u201d said Karen Engle, PRIDE president and chief executive officer. \u201cThat\u2019s our theme for the 2009 Spring Cleanup because our goal is 20,000 volunteers region-wide. This is a big territory, and we need that many volunteers to make it look its best. .\u201d PRIDE coordinators are volunteers who play a vital role in building PRIDE in their communities. The coordinators work with the PRIDE staff to organize cleanup activities, recruit volunteers and track cleanup results. They assist local officials with the programs of PRIDE, a nonprofit organization that promotes environmental cleanup and education in 38 counties. PRIDE coordinators are planning each community\u2019s Spring Cleanup activities. Throughout April, volunteers will pick up roadside litter and beautify welcome areas. PRIDE will give each volunteer a free T-shirt, as well as supply their trash bags, gloves and vests. PRIDE will help local governments pay for trash disposal and beautification projects. Hundreds of volunteers are needed for several large cleanup events in the Laurel County area. On April 4, volunteers will pick up trash along KY 90 near Cumberland Falls State Resort Park during the PRIDE Spring Cleanup Kickoff. On April 18, the annual Laurel Lake Cleanup will be held. The annual Woods Creek Lake Cleanup will be April 25. April is also Redbud Month, and freshly cleaned roads will welcome the tourists who want to enjoy the region\u2019s native Eastern Redbud trees. Redbud Month is sponsored by TOUR Southern and Eastern Kentucky, which is the region\u2019s tourism development organization and PRIDE\u2019s partner in making our region a more beautiful place to call home. Qualifying communities will receive hundreds of redbud seedlings from TOUR SEKY and eight-feet-tall redbud trees from PRIDE. Redbud Month information is available at ww.tourseky.com or by contacting Michelle Spencer at mspencer@tourseky.com or 677-6142.

    "text": "Audit alleges discrepancies with emergency director over $1.8 million grant. Audit alleges discrepancies with emergency director over $1.8 million grant After an audit revealed he misspent $1.87 million in federal funds \u2014 much of which went into the coffers of his wife\u2019s company \u2014 Brian Reams has been fired from his position as director of the division of public safety and emergency management. The audit also blames the Laurel County Fiscal Court for lack of oversight. The audit has been referred to the Kentucky Attorney General\u2019s Office, the FBI and the United States Department of Homeland Security. Reams did not respond to a request for comment. Laurel County Judge-Executive Lawrence Kuhl fired Reams at the Emergency Operations Center and asked him to leave the building Tuesday morning. \u201cNaturally, I hate the whole situation,\u201d Kuhl said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of it. None of us were aware of it until their findings. It\u2019s a tough decision that has to be made by us and by me.\u201d Fourth-district magistrate Jeff Book expressed his disapproval. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in someone of Mr. Reams\u2019 status, with the magnitude of his position as the EMS director, director of CSEPP, homeland security, just the magnitude of his office, spending federal tax dollars coming into the county for emergency operations and the protection of our citizens being spent for what appears to be other reasons,\u201d he said.Second-district magistrate Tom Baker echoed Book\u2019s sentiment. \u201cI feel anger, disappointment that our county has been dragged into this,\u201d he said. The audit, released by state auditor Crit Luallen\u2019s office, reported the Laurel County Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program received the $1.8 million grant so Reams could buy specific equipment for 10 Kentucky counties. Reams reportedly received two bids for the project, which he opened alone, rather than going through the fiscal court. The contract was ultimately awarded to PREP, a business owned by Melody Vess Reams. Melody Vess and Brian Reams married in June 2008. The equipment purchased by PREP \u2014 Providing Response and Emergency Preparedness \u2014 was far inferior to what was supposed to be bought as per the grant\u2019s specifications. For example, the project called for 40, 8,000-watt generators but PREP delivered 40, 3,000-watt generators. \u201cBased on Internet research for comparable prices, it appears that the invoice also overcharged for these generators by as much as $900 each,\u201d the audit reads. \u201cIt appears CSEPP overpaid at least $35,402 for these generators.\u201d The grant also called for the purchase of 40, 7 foot-by-18 foot Homesteader trailers. Instead, PREP delivered 40 LA Cargo trailers. \u201cQuestions were raised by one county CSEPP coordinator as to whether these were even new trailers due to deteriorated conditions in some areas,\u201d the report reads. Gary Epperson, CSEPP director for Clark County, was taken aback by the equipment he received. \u201cI was one of the people who was a little surprised we weren\u2019t getting what we thought we were getting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were under the impression that we couldn\u2019t get what we wanted. That\u2019s what we were told. It was indicated at some meetings that we were having a cost overrun.\u201d Epperson said Clark County\u2019s trailer looked new but \u201cit wasn\u2019t the brand we thought we were getting. \u201d\u201cI think everybody was concerned it wasn\u2019t exactly what we expected to get,\u201d he said. \u201cThe generators were the thing that stood way out. They weren\u2019t really strong enough to power the equipment.\u201d Nevertheless, PREP submitted an invoice asking for $530,446 to pay for supplies. CSEPP Public Information Officer Monica French said questions arose about the grant in August 2008, shortly after CSEPP Program Coordinator Mark Klaas and Kentucky Department of Emergency Management Director Brig. Gen. John Heltzel took over. French said the issue was brought to their attention immediately. \u201cWe cooperated completely with the auditors,\u201d French said. \u201cWe want to ensure to everyone we are trying to make this right. That\u2019s why we go in and inventory everything now. They will go and look at the property and check it out. We are putting new policies and procedures in place.\u201d The Luallen audit was based on one performed by London-based Christian, Sturgeon & Associates, whose report questioned the entire cost related to the $1.87 million grant. However, the Christian report also places blame on the Laurel County Fiscal Court, saying it \u201cdid not properly oversee the bid process, bid award and procurement process. \u201d\u201cAs a result, improprieties occurred,\u201d it reads. The report states, \u201cbids for materials, supplies or equipment must be obtained for expenditures that exceed $20,000.\u201d In the case of the grant, the bids did not even go through the fiscal court. In its finding, the Christian report said the court \u201cshould not engage in related party transactions.\u201d The audit shows in May 2008 a purchase request was forwarded from Reams to the fiscal court for the purchase of parts and maintenance in the amount of $9,996.15. \u201cThe purchase requisition was pending at the time the Director (Reams) became married to the owner of PREP,\u201d it reads. Allison Martin, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Attorney General\u2019s office, said they have not yet received a copy of the audit, but will review it once they do. If warranted, charges would be filed in the coming weeks. Kevin Pickering, external affairs officer in FEMA Region IV, said FEMA is taking a wait-and-see approach. \u201cIt\u2019s primarily a state issue at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cFEMA has and will continue to support the commonwealth of Kentucky as it investigates alleged misuse of CSEPP funds in Laurel County. Based on the results of that investigation, when it\u2019s finished, FEMA will assess further action.\u201d Staff writer Tara Kaprowy can be reached by e-mail at tkaprowy@sentinel-echo.com.",

When the smoke cleared, the HSBC Juggernauts, Dale Crandall, John Matthews and Jason Jones, took home first place. As they celebrated their victory with some of their fellow HSBC employees, they admitted it was not all smooth sailing. \u201cWe had our lowest score with the SEC questions and we were fortunate with the Monopoly questions to make some good guesses,\u201d Jones said. The team vowed they will return in 2010 to defend their title. Kathryn Hardeman, executive director of Laurel County Adult Education and Literacy, said the event raised $3,750 for the organization. \u201cThat money is used to pay for scholarships,\u201d Hardeman said. \u201cMost of the grant money we receive is marked for specific projects. It\u2019s nice to have some money you can use however you need it.\u201d The team from St. Joseph London finished second, followed by the team from First Christian Chruch in third. \u201cWe had really good participation,\u201d Hardeman said. \u201cWe are open to suggestions as we plan for next year.\u201d The HSBC Juggernauts, Dale Crandall, John Matthew and Jason Jones are presented the trophy for winning the 2009 trivia bee by Katherine Hardeman and Tommy Weatherly of Laurel County Adult Education and Literacy.",

    "text": "Church & State in downtown Los Angeles. The bar section at Church & State, a new restaurant in downtown Los Angeles, has a recipe written on a column for drinking absinthe. The restaurant is in the National Biscuit Co. building. If you tried the restaurant when it opened and were disappointed, let me just say this: After a rocky start that ended in the original chef leaving, the restaurant is really humming. Manzke is throwing himself into the bistro genre with gusto. He's making his own charcuterie. He's changing the menu every few days. He's in the zone. For anyone looking for a restaurant downtown that has good food, and feels festive and fun, all without straining the pocketbook too much, that place is Church & State. Manzke is working like someone possessed. He's the guy in the open kitchen with the flattop haircut and an old-fashioned kind of face that wouldn't look out of place on the AMC series \"Mad Men.\" Hands-on all the way, he's even crafting his own hardwood cutting boards for the charcuterie and cheese platters. Originally the loading dock of the 1925 National Biscuit Co. building, the one big dining room has a funky festive look with piazza lights strung across the high ceilings with visible pipes and ducts. Old mirrors and chairs with red leather seats complete the bistro look and tall windows look out onto Industrial Street and the Toy Factory Lofts across the street. The neighborhood can be dicey, but this precious little block is full of life in the dark -- loft dwellers walking their dogs, downtown folks bicycling home, high heels clicking on the sidewalks. With the spangled lights reflected in the windows across the way, this tiny section of the city begins to take on some of the industrial chic of the meatpacking district in New York. The clatter and bang from the kitchen competes with the music pumping out from the sound system -- all you feel is the beat: it's hard to tell what it is. But nobody seems to care: They're too busy eating and drinking, big groups of six or eight friends crowded in at one table, or couples strung out at small tables along the back wall. At one, a slender girl in a tight black vest, short skirt and black stockings toasts her companion and digs into an iced platter of oysters. They're Kumamotos and Kushis from the Northwest, nice and cold, fresh and delicious. Dishes to share The server madly pushes candles, plates, glasses away to clear a space in the middle of the table for the charcuterie presented on a foot-and-a-half-long cutting board. Most of it is made in-house -- lovely rounds of rabbit galantine studded with pistachios, a delicate partridge terrine with truffles, (pig's feet and Kurobuta ham with parsley pressed into a rectangle), slivers of deep red duck breast prosciutto (not all of them are available every day). Manzke also turns out French canning jars filled with pork rillettes (pork cooked in pork fat that's rather on the lean side here) topped with prunes and Armagnac, and fabulously silky and rich foie gras with a layer of Port gel\u00e9e on top. There's peppery , a large rectangular tart topped with sweet caramelized onions, cubes of bacon and Gruy\u00e8re cheese rather than the traditional cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. It's essentially a tomato-less pizza with bacon. What's not to like? More sumptuous even is the tart blanketed in lemon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, leeks and satiny smoked salmon. Not only is the topping terrific, the crust for both the tarts is thin and crunchy. The secret? The pastry is enriched with a little lard. And both tarts are so large, they're too much for just two. Bring a few friends along and share as an appetizer. And sharing is what most makes sense here. Everyone will want to taste everything. Plates fly around the table as someone wants to try the bouillabaisse, which is a kind of miracle. The broth actually tastes like something from the south of France, redolent of flavorful fish and loaded with prawns, mussels and clams. If you're in a crowd, maybe you'd better get two: The portion isn't huge, which is why they can charge just $18. fried in lard, which gives them a wonderful flavor, even though the aioli that comes with them is too wimpy. How can you not love a bistro that proposes herring and potato salad? In this case it's smoked, marinated herring with boiled fingerling potatoes in a bright, vinegary dressing, with flower-shaped carrot slices for some crunch. Sometimes there's a marvelous leek terrine, pretty and green, and served with a thatch of celery root salad. Don't pass up the escargots, an order of six, each served in an adorable tiny blue and white porcelain dish capped with a golden disk of puff pastry. There are plenty to share -- or maybe not, once you dip your spoon into that garlicky snail butter and find out how good snails can be when made by somebody who really knows how to cook. Keeping it simple Manzke has wisely stripped the menu down to a single page, with most main courses under $20. Even the very decent steak frites, which come with house-made b\u00e9arnaise, come in a smaller size -- a for a mere $14 as opposed to $24 for the regular. We're all seeking comfort food right now and chicken \u00e0 la Bourgeoise is just what's required, moist tender chicken roasted with carrots, pearl onions and bacon and served with a splash of the pan drippings. Manzke does a fine duck confit too, served with luscious braised red cabbage.",

    "text": "Missing Lancaster girl's body is found as mother's story unravels. A chilling report that a Lancaster mother had been knocked unconscious by an attacker and her 18-month-old daughter abducted Wednesday afternoon triggered a frantic search by authorities for the missing child. That search ended nearly a dozen hours later Thursday, though, when police discovered the toddler's body dumped by the side of a road in Sylmar, near the Golden State Freeway. Now, in the wake of the discovery, investigators are saying there are problems with the mother's explanation. Emma Leigh Barker's remains were found by investigators after they determined there \"were several inconsistencies\" with her mother's story, authorities said. The girl's body was found near Roxford Street and El Dorado Avenue, concealed by deep overgrown brush alongside a fence. Authorities said it appeared the girl's 25-pound body had been dumped sometime over the last 24 hours and showed no visible signs of trauma. The girl's mother, Stacy Barker, 20, initially told detectives that she was at a Lancaster park next to the Antelope Valley Freeway about 5 p.m. and had placed Emma in her car seat. The mother said she was \"struck from behind by an unknown assailant\" and knocked unconscious, sheriff's homicide Lt. Pat Nelson said. Barker insisted to detectives she awoke about 10:30 p.m. several miles away at a Palmdale park-and-ride on Avenue S and her daughter was missing. The mother's brother called authorities, and deputies were dispatched to the park-and-ride lot. Deputies found the mother semiconscious and partly undressed with visible bruises on her head, Nelson said. The Sheriff's Department began searching for the girl at 11 p.m. Wednesday. Investigators put out a description of the girl as being 30 inches tall and wearing blue-jean shorts and a multicolored polka dot top. Photos of Emma's smiling face filled Los Angeles television airwaves Thursday morning as investigators conducted a high-profile search for the missing toddler. Sources familiar with the investigation said the mother changed her story by Thursday and was insisting that Emma's death was an accident. Investigators and the county coroner's office must now determine how the girl died. The mother is now helping investigators. \"She is not in custody. She is cooperating with the investigation,\" Nelson said. Barker is \"not considered a suspect\" at this point, he said. \"But that may change\" as the investigation continues, he said. When asked whether there were other persons of interest, Nelson said that investigators were \"working additional leads,\" but \"nobody specific\" was under investigation. Sheriff's investigators late Thursday night confirmed that the body was that of Emma.",

    "text": "Solar energy proposal goes down to defeat. Measure B falls short of a majority in a blow to Villaraigosa and a labor group whose top officials proposed it. San Fernando City Councilwoman Nury Martinez wins school board seat. The solar energy ballot measure known as Measure B went down to defeat Thursday as Los Angeles election officials finished their count of the remaining 49,000 mail-in, provisional and damaged ballots. Sixteen days after the election, city officials announced that Measure B had fallen short of a majority -- with 50.5% of voters opposing the plan and 49.5% in favor of it. The final count left Measure B trailing by 2,644 votes. The defeat dealt a blow to the hopes of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who had spent $145,000 from a campaign committee on behalf of the measure and appeared in a blitz of television commercials promoting it. But it also was a setback for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, whose top officials had proposed Measure B. The union's various locals, nationals and affiliated nonprofit groups had spent more than $673,000 toward its passage -- more than half of the total collected by the Measure B campaign. Labor groups provided two-thirds of the campaign's funding. Measure B would have required the city Department of Water and Power to install 400 megawatts of solar panels by 2014. All the work would have been performed by DWP employees represented by the electrical workers union. Backers said it would have reduced the city's reliance on fossil fuels, provided more dependable power and created good jobs. Opponents said it would have hiked electrical rates significantly and locked out construction trade workers In the closely divided race to replace Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein, San Fernando City Councilwoman Nury Martinez defeated educator Louis Pugliese, a two-time school board candidate. On election night, Pugliese trailed Martinez by 482 votes.",

    "text": "Trucking toward a port-pollution solution. The gig: Founder and chief executive of one of Los Angeles' smallest publicly traded firms. Balqon Corp. is a 12-employee company that recently completed the assembly of the first in a series of heavy-duty electric trucks that will be hauling cargo at the Port of Los Angeles, the nation's busiest container port. The L.A. port has signed on for 25 trucks at a cost of $5.7 million. Samra is hoping to market the technology to railroads and others. Family influence: Samra, 46, who was born near New Delhi, is the first male in his family to choose a civilian career over the military. Samra jokes that his civilian status makes him \"the only wimp in the family,\" but discipline seems to run in his blood. Samra says he barely allowed himself to sleep during college and often works as late as 1 a.m. Background: Samra came to the U.S. in 1980 and went to work on his first day in the country at Micro Peripherals in Chatsworth. Later, as the quality-control manager for a U.S. electronics firm called Flextronics, he held overseas factories to a 100-point efficiency and quality measurement standard, demanding that each subcontractor show improvement in performance annually. He held himself to the same rigid standards when he formed Balqon in 2005. Education: Chemical engineering degree from Panjab University. Samra says he has never used his chemical engineering training and viewed every firm that contracted with his employers as a case study on how to run a business. The problem: Samra's company had the expertise to design its electric vehicle but didn't have the capital or a location suitable for a vehicle assembly line. The breakthrough: In the Port of Los Angeles, Samra found the rough equivalent of a venture capitalist and a technology incubator desperate for answers to Southern California's biggest single source of air pollution. Under an arrangement with the port and the South Coast Air Quality Management District, Balqon got $527,000 in seed money to build and test a prototype. Samra was required to move his company across the county line from Santa Ana to Los Angeles, and he found an office park facility in Harbor City that was large enough to work on several trucks at once. Coming together: The truck chassis arrives pre-assembled, but without an engine or a standard transmission. Power is generated through two trays of seven forklift batteries. Samra doesn't talk about the controller itself or the software that runs it. \"That would be the secret sauce,\" he quips. Hobbies: None. The Laguna Hills resident is so busy with his new truck line that he has time only for work. Bare bones: Walk into the Balqon offices, and no one greets you. The company is hiring engineers first and a receptionist later. Samra's office has that just-moved-in look, even though Balqon relocated seven months ago. A copy of Ayn Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\" sits untouched on the corner of his desk where a Christmas gift-giver left it. \"Maybe by next Christmas,\" he says.",

    "text": "Tour traces L.A.'s spiritual diversity. Subtitled \"L.A.'s Unique Spiritual Legacy,\" the tour featured five venues that contributed to the spiritual traditions of the region. As the main title suggested, it was all about people seeking something beyond themselves. In addition to seeing the fellowship on Mount Washington, people who took the driving tour visited the Chapel of Jesus Ethic in Glendale, the Philosophical Research Society in Los Feliz, the Bonnie Brae House in Historic Filipinotown and one of the most recognizable religious buildings in Los Angeles: the domed Angelus Temple in Echo Park. In a printed guide to the tour, Trudi Sandmeier, director of education for the conservancy, wrote, \"As our 'City of Seekers' tour illustrates, our built environment is rich in historic religious sites, both traditional and nontraditional.\" would fall in the latter category. The organization was founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda, an Indian swami who introduced America to yoga and gained a worldwide following with his \"Autobiography of a Yogi. It's said that Yogananda had a vision of the Mount Washington site, which offers commanding views of downtown Los Angeles. As docents explained, the Mount Washington Hotel opened there in 1910 and was connected to the flatlands 940 feet below by an incline railway that was dismantled long ago. In 1925 the Mission Revival-style hotel was purchased by Yogananda, who made the site his headquarters. It remains a center for study and meditation. As one of the docents explained, pointing to parts of the complex, \"Nuns to the right; monks to the left.\" The rich and famous were among Yogananda's friends, including conductor Leopold Stokowski and famed horticulturist Luther Burbank. Which brings us to the cactus. As the story goes, Burbank talked lovingly to a cactus, so reassuring and calming that the plant dropped its needles. A cutting from the cactus was planted at the Self-Realization Fellowship and still flourishes, free of spines. Yogananda blended Eastern traditions, such as breath control, with Christianity. Indeed, visitors to the center's library could see another of his many books, \"The Yoga of Jesus,\" whose cover depicts Jesus sitting in a lotus position. To the west, across the street from the Glendale Galleria, the Chapel of Jesus Ethic offered another example of religious synthesis. The building, with a sweeping roof and lots of windows, is an example of the Modern design school popular in the 1960s. A garden is based on a garden found at Yogananda's fellowship. The complex was built as the centerpiece for the (pronounced NISH-ence), which also blends Christianity with Eastern belief systems and practices, such as meditation. Founded by Colton, who died in 1984 two months shy of her 86th birthday, the foundation also places a premium on the creative arts. The conservancy's tour booklet offered this striking anecdote: \"It was while conducting worship services in the Chapel of the Jesus Ethic on Aug. 12, 1973, that Colton experienced what is described by her followers as a levitation miracle. At this moment, as witnessed by those in the congregation, her body rose into the air and turned over, landing on her back a short distance down the aisle from her original position. She explained that this phenomenon was the power of Christ overtaking her body to demonstrate his physical and spiritual power.\" A short drive away was yet another example of how Angelenos have blended traditions and schools of thought. The , near Griffith Park, was the headquarters of Manly P. Hall, who over six decades wrote more than 200 books on philosophy and spiritual practices. His best-known work was the modestly titled \"The Secret Teachings of All Ages: An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy.\" The headquarters is a visual encyclopedia of sorts. It was built in Mayan Revival style, but the carved wooden doors to the library feature Confucius and Plato. Statues are modeled on designs from ancient Egypt. Embedded in the courtyard is a bit of tile from in England, thought by some to be the burial site of King Arthur. The next two sites on the tour reflected sweeping movements of Christianity. The Bonnie Brae House west of downtown is a simple cream-colored wood house surrounded by modest homes and apartments. It may not look like much, but this was where the modern Pentecostal movement was born in 1906. Tradition holds that William J. Seymour and some fellow worshipers there were overtaken by the Holy Spirit and began speaking in tongues. This led to the movement that became known as the could hold 5,300 people when completed in 1923 at the direction of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. The building, a blend of vaguely classical columns and arches contrasted with art deco rectangles, looms over Echo Park. Inside visitors gawked at the two balconies and the 30-foot windows designed by \"Sister Aimee.\" By mid-afternoon, a rock band set up in the sanctuary and began to practice -- loudly -- for a service geared toward a young audience. The tour-takers, who were old enough to have annoyed their own parents by cranking up Rolling Stones albums, could not stand the volume for long and left the sanctuary. But, in a sense, the band was just doing what worshipers did there generations ago, though at a lower decibel level. They were seeking something as well. That's what tied Angelus Temple to the other tour venues. Like that cactus at the swami's retreat, many people are looking for a safe place to grow, a place where there's no need for spines.",

Despite losing $2.1 billion in revenue for 2008, American Airlines announced Monday that its subsidiary, American Eagle, would introduce six new regional services, including one from Manhattan Regional Airport. At a news conference Monday, American Airlines representative Dale Morris joked about the company not having gone bankrupt and said that a year ago, high fuel prices would not have permitted the new route from Manhattan to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Scheduled to begin Aug. 25, the twice-daily, non-stop service would offer 50 seats on an Embraer jet. Ticket fares have not been announced. They are expected to cost, one-way, about $40 to $100 more than a flight from Kansas City International to Dallas, when purchased two to three weeks in advance, said Richard Jankovich, airport advisory board chairman.",

Pottawatomie County likely will be the biggest economic benefactor of a US-24 corridor expansion project, according to preliminary results of a study funded by area government and KDOT. That was the message consultants told visitors at a town hall meeting at the Green Valley Community Center Wednesday evening. The study is being performed in part to assess the effect that recent and future economic expansion will have on the highway and jobs in the Manhattan area through 2030. It is also looking at what those effects will be and where they will occur. Similar studies are being performed in other counties through which US-24 runs, such as Leavenworth and Shawnee. The National Bio- and Agro-defense Facility and the jobs it likely will create in the Manhattan area also was a major factor in the local study. Consultants said they based it in part on communities with similar federal research facilities, such as Fermilab in Kane County, Ill., and NERI in Jefferson County, Colo. A similar meeting was held Wednesday in St. George. A third meeting takes place at 5 this evening at the Wamego Seniors Center. Staff photo by Michael Schweitzer Graham Smith, left , with Gould Evans, and Frank Leone, an administrator at the Flint Hills Christian School and member of the Highway 24 advisory committee, talk about proposed changes to the highway during an informational meeting Wednesday afternoon at the Green Valley Community Center.",

    "text": "Snow, ice blanket Kansas; two dead. KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u00e2 \u201d Tens of thousands of Kansas utility customers were without power Saturday and two deaths were reported as an early spring blizzard buried parts of Kansas in snow and ice. A 72-year-old man Hutchinson man was shoveling snow and died of an apparent heart attack Saturday, according to the adjutant general's office. On Friday, a 58-year-old woman was killed in a car accident on icy roadways in Marion County. '' Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of this storm,'' Gov. Kathleen Sebelius said in a news release. '' Many roads in our state are still treacherous, so please be careful as you travel and take extra precautions when walking or working in the current conditions.'' The storm, which dropped several inches of snow around Riley County Friday night and Saturday, did little damage locally, officials said. '' We haven't had any calls,'' said Emergency Management Director Pat Collins. '' There were no roads closed, we haven't been busy at all.'' Collins said crews were out early to prepare roads around the county. Police officials said there were several non-serious wrecks on Interstate 70, but that drivers stayed indoors for the most part. Westar Energy said about 12,700 customers were without power as of about 8:30 p.m. Saturday. The utility said it had restored power to more than 60,000 customers since the storm began, with some customers experiencing multiple outages. Kansas Electric Cooperatives Inc. said five rural electric cooperatives were reporting outages to a combined 5,000 meters, which can serve multiple homes and businesses. Kansas City Power & Light was reporting 2,300 consumers were in the dark, primarily in Anderson County. Most of the utility problems were in south-central Kansas, where up to an eighth of an inch of ice was causing tree branches to snap and knocking down power lines. Ice accumulations were from a quarter inch to an inch across the Flint Hills and parts of southeast Kansas. Much of the state was dealing with heavy snow and a mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The National Weather Service said the heaviest snow had fallen in parts of southwest Kansas, including 28 inches in the Pratt area with six-foot snow drifts. '' There's a good swath of our area that's covered with at least a foot of snow,'' said Matt Girard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Dodge City. Heavy winds accompanying the snow diminished visibility in many communities to almost zero and forced authorities to close several local and state highways. Still, the storm was blamed for numerous accidents. Much of central, eastern and southeastern Kansas were reporting a foot and a half or less of snow but were more concerned about the freezing rain making driving even more challenging. The Kansas Department of Transportation said several highways were closed in southwest Kansas due to poor visibility and blowing snow, including long stretches of such major routes as U.S. 54, 56, 83, 160, 183, 283 and 400. Part of U.S. 83 south out of Garden City was reopened, as was U.S. 50 west of Dodge City. Maj. Gen. Tod Bunting, the adjutant general, said a guard search and rescue team in Pratt County reported rescuing two stranded motorists near Pratt. The adjutant general's office also reported that emergency crews in Hutchinson responded to three partially collapsed building. Partial building collapses also were reported in Harvey, Harper and Kingman counties, but no injuries were reported. The Highway Patrol also sent out a plane Saturday to fly over areas of southwest and south-central Kansas to look for stranded drivers. And National Guard helicopters were assisting with search and rescue efforts. The National Guard also opened armories in Dodge City, Great Bend, Hutchinson, Kingman, Larned, Pratt and West Wichita Saturday as warming stations. Earlier Saturday, Sebelius signed a declaration of disaster emergency for 62 counties, allowing state resources to help local officials.",

As the roaring fire consumed the yacht, Nicholas DiGiacomo gave one of the trapped passengers his air pack and mask, put himself at the mercy of the thick smoke and used his power saw to cut open an escape route in the yacht's hull. The Miami-Dade Fire Rescue firefighter saved both passengers at the Miami Beach Marina on March 31, 2008. On Friday, he received the Silver Medal of Valor. More than 60 firefighters and police received awards for their acts of bravery in 2008, such as saving babies from burning buildings, snatching swimmers from rough seas and pulling people out of wrecked cars. CBS4 anchor Michael Williams presented dozens of awards, including one to firefighter Anthony Oro, who held onto a woman's hand for two hours on May 14 beneath the sweltering sun while fellow firefighters cut away at the car in which she was trapped. Another award was given to firefighter and diver Augustin Hondares, whose Fire Rescue unit responded April 20 when a child's parents were trapped under water in a car. Hondares drove to the canal, so he had no time to put on his scuba gear. He instead held his breath, dove into the cold, murky water and pulled out one passenger. He then dove back in, located the second passenger, and had Lt. Richard Rosell pull the man out. Although both parents later died at the hospital, Hondares, Rosell and others received awards for their heroic efforts. DiGiacomo credited teamwork for helping firefighters save two people from the burning yacht. '' We couldn't fathom not getting them out,'' he said. Those thoughts ``can't even creep in.'' Fire Chief Herminio Lorenzo said the firefighters earned their awards by taking their skills and sense of honor with them to all places, on and off the job. '' The individuals we honor today are those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty . . . who went beyond logic and common sense -- to save somebody,'' he said.",

    "text": "Fire near Orlando might shut I-4. Mar. 21 -- The smoke is back -- and with it the need for drivers to check conditions before they hit the road. A rapidly growing brush fire made commuting an ordeal for drivers on Interstate 4 on Friday night and threatens to close the highway today between DeLand and Daytona Beach if winds flare up as expected. '' It's [the weather] so unpredictable, we never know when we're going to have to shut it down,'' said Sgt. Kim Miller, a Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman. Fifteen brush fires were burning in Volusia County on Friday, and another was under control in Osceola. The largest, spanning 800 acres near State Road 44, was first reported March 6 and was caused by people, according to the U.S. Forestry Service Web site. It doubled in size from Thursday morning to Friday night, said Shelley Szafraniec, a Volusia County spokeswoman. It is in a wooded, swampy area near DeLand difficult for firefighters to reach, she said. The blaze was within an eighth of a mile of I-4, but officials said they didn't plan to close the road unless it burned closer. Motorists were advised to slow down and use their lights if visibility dims. '' People need to use caution in this area,'' Szafraniec said. The flames, fanned by high winds, jumped a line that firefighters plowed. They weren't visible from the road. But smoke could be seen -- and smelled -- as far away as north Seminole County. Eight Florida Highway Patrol troopers were monitoring conditions. If flames burn across the highway, the road would be closed between I-95 and S.R. 472, Miller said. Dry weather is expected to continue until the rainy season starts in mid-May, said Bob Wimmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Melbourne. Winds, which are expected to kick up to 20mph this afternoon, won't help. '' Conditions have been dry, and we're getting into the driest part of our year,'' he said. A La Nina weather pattern is partly to blame, said Tony Cristaldi, another weather-service meteorologist. The phenomenon, which shifts Pacific Ocean temperatures and North American wind patterns, usually turns the rain spigot off for Florida during the winter and spring. The system is weakening, but ''the atmosphere doesn't instantaneously react,'' Cristaldi said. ``We're expected to stay dry right through the spring.'' The Florida Division of Forestry is working to control the flames with help from Volusia County firefighters, said Timber Weller of the forestry division. '' Being this dry, and the humidity being low, makes it very difficult to stop a fire,'' he said. ``The conditions are really stacked against them [firefighters] right now.'' Meanwhile, a 300-acre-plus brush fire was contained by Friday night in east Osceola County. The fire is near Crabgrass, Owens and Harris roads east of rural Holopaw, county spokeswoman Niki Whisler said. One or two dozen homes are nearby but are not in immediate danger, she said. '' One problem we have is the wind keeps shifting,'' Whisler said. The fire started Thursday, died down and flared again Friday.",

    "text": "Democrats blast Bill McCollum's public service ads. Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum appears in nearly every frame of a 30-second, widely run commercial warning parents and children about sex offenders online. '' This ad needed a message. It needed a messenger,'' he said Thursday. ``It couldn't be just done with words.'' But Gov. Charlie Crist and Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink -- whose public service announcements were nominated for regional Emmy awards last year -- stayed out of the ads. And unlike McCollum, a Republican who hired his 2006 campaign media consultant to produce and air his ad, Crist and Sink sought competitive bids for the ad contracts. '' CFO Sink wanted to make sure Floridians were getting the best deal possible, so she required a competitive bidding process,'' said Kyra Jennings, a spokeswoman for the Democratic officeholder. ``There's also a big distinction from the attorney general's ads in that they feature him so prominently.'' McCollum's $1.4 million media blitz has become a target for the Florida Democratic Party, which says the ads cross the line from public service announcements into political commercials. Party spokesman Eric Jotkoff singled out a $550 expenditure for makeup among the production costs. '' While the attorney general claims that this ad campaign was about promoting public safety, it shouldn't take a $550 makeup job in a vain attempt to make him look good politically,'' he said. McCollum is expected to run for reelection in 2010, though he may run for governor if Crist does not seek another term. Asked about the makeup after he did a cybercrime presentation at Westpine Middle School in Sunrise, McCollum said, ``I didn't know how much the makeup artist costs. It's a package . . . the makeup comes with it.'' In his most extensive comments on the ads since The Miami Herald wrote about them last week, McCollum emphasized that they were bought not with tax dollars, but with money from settlements with companies accused of hiding the costs of cellphone services. The ads run by Crist and Sink were funded with taxpayer money. McCollum said he hired his former campaign consultant, Chris Mottola, because the state's competitive bidding process was ''very slow, very complicated.'' He cited an exemption in state law that allows him to use a no-bid contract for ``artistic services.'' The ad shows McCollum speaking directly to the camera about the dangers of Internet sex predators, with children walking school hallways and using a laptop in the background. '' The development of the ad is artistic. It's how you present it,'' McCollum said. ``You got 30 seconds to be able to tell somebody something.'' The governor's ''Explore Adoption'' campaign last year included five different television videos, including one featuring a boy with his adoptive father at the batting cages. The cost of producing and airing the videos, as well as related radio and billboard ads, was about $650,000. Sink's ''My Safe Florida Homes'' ads, which cost $1.06 million, show consumers on their computers applying for free hurricane inspections. For the attorney general's ads, Philadelphia-based Mottola received 10 percent of the cost of the television time, plus about $38,000 for production, according to McCollum's office. That means he earned about $136,000 on the deal -- more than the $87,511 he was paid by McCollum during the 2006 campaign. '' We felt as a team that we had the very best in the business to make this film at a very good price,'' McCollum said. ```I would expect if we continue to run this ad we would probably use him again to make the buy.'' McCollum has approval from the Florida Legislature to spend another $1.1 million in settlement cash on the cybercrime ad. It is currently airing in South Florida in English and Spanish, where it ran for part of January and all of February. It also ran for six weeks over the summer in Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Pensacola, Panama City and Gainesville. McCollum's office released an e-mail from a mother who said that until she saw the ad, she didn't know where to turn when her daughter received naked pictures on her cellphone. '' The good news is that we've gotten their attention,'' McCollum said. ``I don't care if anyone wants to criticize the ad. It's been effective.''",

    "text": "New U.S. Airline Cleared to Fly to Petersburg. Major airlines are slashing prices and grounding planes to remain profitable in the tough global economy. But a group of investors believe that the time is ripe to launch a new airline offering flights between New York and St. Petersburg. Baltia Air Lines has won approval from the U.S. Transportation Department to provide nonstop service between New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and St. Petersburg's Pulkovo 2 Airport, and the flights will start this summer, the airline's chief executive, Igor Dmitrowsky, told The Moscow Times. The airline will initially offer the round-trip flights once a week on a Boeing 747, later expanding to three days per week and then five days per week, Dmitrowsky said. The eight-hour flight will be the first direct connection between St. Petersburg and any city in North America, which Dmitrowsky sees as an unfilled niche that will give the airline an advantage. Dmitrowsky said the economic downturn would also make Baltia competitive. \"Frankly, these are the best of times for us. The fuel price has gone down dramatically, and the other costs are not so extreme,\" Dmitrowsky said by telephone from New York. \"Can you imagine if we were living in an era where Pan Am was flourishing along with other major airlines with no debt?\" he said. \"We would have such a hard time breaking into the market and an even harder time staying afloat.\" Baltia intends to offer three-class service in its aircraft, which will feature a white fuselage with a red tail emblazoned with a white rooster, representing punctuality. The airlines currently offering direct flights to the United States -- Aeroflot, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines -- provide two-class service. A fourth carrier, United Airlines, will start flights to Russia next Sunday after postponing the Washington-Moscow route last year because of high fuel costs. Oil prices have dropped from a high of about $150 last summer to around $50 last week. But the financial crisis has since enveloped the global economy, discouraging business and leisure travel and forcing airlines to cut prices and capacity. Last week, United Airlines slashed prices to mark the start of the new daily flights between Washington's Dulles Airport and Moscow's Domodedovo Airport. Sample fares on the airline's web site show one-way tickets to Moscow via Dulles costing $119 from New York and $167 from Los Angeles. The tickets must be purchased by Thursday, and travel is between March 29 and April 30. Several other airlines dropped their prices below $500 for round-trip flights to Moscow last week, said Rick Seaney, chief executive of FareCompare.com. Seaney linked the price cuts to the crisis. \"You have to understand that this is an absolutely crazy airfare environment,\" he said in a column on the ABC News web site. \"The airlines are trying to fill up their planes, but people are procrastinating -- while others just aren't flying. ... So we get the yo-yo price game: When nobody's buying tickets, prices take a dive.\" He said he found American Airlines offering one round-trip fare of $205 from Baltimore to Moscow. Baltia's ticket costs will remain \"along the lines of the current price structure on carriers with connecting services,\" Dmitrowsky said. But Baltia's web site is already promoting a host of discounts to students, seniors and youth. During the first month of service, all passengers will receive 25 percent off the ticket cost, and the first 300 passengers to book flights will receive a free ticket for future use. The date for Baltia's inaugural flight remains to be set, pending approval of its air certification documents from the Federal Aviation Authority, Dmitrowsky said. He said approval was expected within three months. The airline, based in Rego Park, New York, will start service with a single 747. It hopes to start nonstop flights between New York and Moscow, Kiev, Minsk and Riga next year. Dmitrowsky, a U.S. citizen born in Riga, founded a kefir company in 1979 and led it to a public offering in 1986. He has financed several aircraft and automotive projects, but his dream for nearly 15 years has been to launch Baltia. Baltia's shares, which trade on the \"over-the-counter bulletin board\" electronic system, closed up 20 percent at $0.04 on Friday after seeing a 52-week low of $0.01 on Nov. 12 and a high of $0.07 on March 24. Dmitrowsky faces an uphill battle. Airlines could lose more than $2.5 billion in 2009 after cargo volume dropped by 23 percent and passenger traffic fell by 5.6 percent in January, the International Air Transport Association said last week. Aviation industry insiders questioned the wisdom of United Airlines' plans to fly to Russia when they were announced last year, noting that flights between Moscow and the United States were rarely filled. United Airlines said at the time that planes on the Moscow flights would carry a combination of passengers and freight, making the route profitable. American Airlines started flights to Moscow from its home base in Chicago last year. Delta has been flying between Moscow and two U.S. cities, New York and Atlanta, for years. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.",

    "text": "At Least 17 Slain in Dagestani Battle. MAKHACHKALA -- Three days of intense fighting between police and insurgents in a wooded area of Dagestan ended Saturday with five officers and about a dozen militants left dead, officials said. Clashes are frequent in Dagestan, but the fighting in an area near the border with Georgia and Azerbaijan was some of the most intense in recent months. Helicopter gunships fired on the militant positions. Regional Interior Ministry spokesman Mark Tolchinsky said 14 insurgents were killed, but Interfax cited the Federal Security Service as saying 12 died. \"The group committed several crimes in two regions in Dagestan,\" Dagestani Interior Minister Adilgirei Magomedtagirov told reporters. \"There are at least three non-Russians with Arab nationality among the dead militants, perhaps even four,\" he said. State-owned Vesti-24 television showed a row of dead rebels lying in the snow with Kalashnikov rifles slung across their limp shoulders. Magomedtagirov said a collection of Kalashnikov rifles, machine guns and a sniper rifle were found where the militants were hiding. Earlier, television showed helicopter gunships firing from the snowy skies at targets in a forest and armored vehicles rolling into the mountainous area. The police action, which began Wednesday, came after officials in the regions complained to regional authorities about the presence of the gunmen. Underscoring the seriousness of the fighting, state-run television prominently showed a meeting Friday between Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Dagestan's leader, Mukhu Aliyev. In the Dagestani capital, Makhachkala, police fatally shot four men Friday who failed to stop their car at a checkpoint and began shooting at officers, city police spokesman Shamil Guseinov said. The bodies of the four were shown on television lying among shattered glass near a battered, white Lada car. Dagestan's militants are seen as having been inspired by separatists in neighboring Chechnya. The fighting is the latest round of violence to plague the North Caucasus, pitting criminal gangs, Islamic militants or feuding clans against one another or against government and police forces. A three-hour shootout Thursday north of the capital of Kabardino-Balkaria left four gunmen killed. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.",
