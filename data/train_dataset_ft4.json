Four people died in a stampede at a discotheque in a small town outside Yekaterinburg when word spread that it was offering limited free entry Saturday night, a local police spokesman said Sunday. About 200 people flocked to the discotheque in the Urals town of Pervouralsk after it announced that admission would be free for the first 30 minutes after it opened its doors, spokesman Valery Gorelykh said. Three 16-year-old schoolgirls and a 30-year-old man died in the crush to get to the door, one person was rushed to hospital and seven were treated by paramedics at the scene, he said. The discotheque has a capacity of 400 people, he said. Police have opened an investigation. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.",

  "text": "Murmansk's Governor Resigns. Murmansk Governor Yury Yevdokimov resigned abruptly Saturday after enduring a week of harsh criticism from United Russia over the loss of the Murmansk mayoral election to an independent candidate. President Dmitry Medvedev welcomed Yevdokimov's resignation and appointed Federal Fisheries Agency deputy head Dmitry Dmitriyenko as the acting governor, the Kremlin said. Political analysts said it was the first instance that a regional leader had been forced out of office for supporting a non-United Russia candidate in an election. Independent candidate Sergei Subbotin, a former Murmansk deputy governor, was elected mayor with 61 percent of the vote in a runoff election on March 15, well over the 35 percent collected by the United Russia candidate, incumbent Mayor Mikhail Savchenko. After the election, the new mayor refused to join United Russia but declared himself a supporter of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who heads United Russia. Yevdokimov, a United Russia member, had served as Murmansk governor since 1996 and was appointed by then-President Putin to a fourth term in 2007. In an interview with Gazeta. ru on Thursday, he denied speculation that he would step down. But on Saturday, he said he thought that it would be best for the country if he quit. \"I've always been ready to bear responsibility for my actions,\" he said, Interfax reported. Senior United Russia officials had accused him of violating election law by offering support for the non-United Russia candidate on local television and threatened to throw him out of the party. United Russia said in a weekend statement on its web site that Yevdokimov had resigned on his own accord. The acting governor, Dmitriyenko, 46, served in submarine units of the Navy from 1980 to 1992 and was appointed as deputy head of the Federal Fisheries Agency last year. United Russia welcomed Dmtiriyenko's appointment. \"There is a need for professionals able to work in new ways during crisis conditions,\" party official Sergei Neverov said in the web site statement. Dmitriyenko will be sworn in as governor on Wednesday, pending confirmation by the regional legislature, which is controlled by United Russia. Dmitriyenko flew to Murmansk on Saturday to meet with regional United Russia officials. In his first official statement as acting governor, Dmitriyenko said he would focus on ways to make regional spending more effective. Alexei Titkov, regions analyst at the Institute of Regional Politics, said the shuffle was the first time that a governor has been replaced after a conflict with United Russia over support of a candidate in elections. \"Yevdokimov's resignation will become an example for the other governors,\" Titkov said. The resignation follows a series of replacements started when Medvedev dismissed four governors in February. The president has the right to appoint and dismiss governors under a law proposed by Putin in 2004. Meanwhile, the State Duma on Friday approved in a final third reading a bill that would give the party that holds the most seats in a regional legislature the right to propose gubernatorial candidates. Under the existing procedure, this right belongs to the presidential envoys to the federal districts. The bill, which now must be approved by the Federation Council and then the president, says the party should propose at least three candidates to the president no later than 90 days before the incumbent governor's term expires. If the president doesn't select anyone from this group within a month, the party must propose three more candidates. If the party doesn't do this, the president can select the candidate himself. Also, the president is not obliged to select a candidate from those proposed by the party. The bill was sent to the Duma in December by Medvedev. United Russia controls nearly all the regional legislatures in Russia. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.",

  "text": "Georgia Arrests Opposition Members on Arms Charges. TBILISI, Georgia -- Georgian police in arrested several opposition members on arms charges on Monday, in what their party leader said was a \"campaign of terror\" ahead of anti-government rallies next month. The opposition has stepped up pressure on President Mikheil Saakashvili since Georgia's disastrous defeat by Russia in a five-day war last August and plans a series of protests beginning on April 9 to demand his resignation. The Interior Ministry said 10 people had been arrested on charges of purchasing automatic weapons, including some \"not very high-ranking\" members of the Democratic Movement-United Georgia party led by former Saakashvili ally Nino Burjanadze. Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said police were not specifically linking the arrests to the planned protests. \"We don't claim this to be a political conspiracy,\" he said. \"The only thing we know is that there are people who have expressed interest in buying weapons and have bought weapons. \"This [the police operation] is aimed at preventing any possible violence in the future and to make sure the political processes don't get interrupted by violence that might come from a thousand different sources. \"Police showed journalists about 20 minutes of secretly filmed video of what it said were the suspects buying weapons, which included automatic rifles. Burjanadze said the detained included the party's regional head in the coastal region of Ajara and her husband's driver. \"The authorities have begun a campaign of terror in the country,\" she said. \"This government has little time to rule, so stay calm and don't be provoked.\" Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.",

  "text": "Olympic Problems in Sochi. According to the statements of the Olympic organizers, Russia is not going to abandon its initial plans and obligations related to the Winter Olympic Games 2014 organization in Sochi. The budgets of the Olympic projects, financed either by the state or private investors, are subjected to the review only in connection with the construction budget reduction. But the most burning issue is related to the land plot allocation of the Olympic facilities. It is worth noting that according to the law, the Program for Sochi Development and Olympic Facilities Construction and the data of the organization that carries out the Olympic facilities area planning scheme design and approval (Giprogor Federal State Unitary Enterprise), there is an already determined plot allocation for the Olympic facilities and other building with serve a function to the Olympic facilities. The land plots within the boundaries stated in the approved construction plan, are subject to withdrawal for public needs on the basis of the resolution of the Governor of Krasnodar. The land plots, as well as objects located there, are bought from the private owners on the basis of a market value appraisal report. After the IOC Valuation Committee visit to Sochi in February 2007, the authorities promised to buy land plots from inhabitants of Nizhne-Imeritinskaya Bay, whose land plots were predominantly those subject to withdrawal at the market value, but a year and a half later no land plots purchase agreements had been supplied to their owners. Although according to the laws there is a 20-day window for drafting a purchase agreement upon receipt of an appraiser's report. The department responsible for organizing the Olympic Games in the Krasnodar area responds to the official inquiries that the delays in the statutory period for drafting purchase agreements is caused by the need to update appraisal reports on the market value of the objects to be bought. It should be noted that the process of land plot title registration in Sochi is particularly inefficient in terms of time and money. For this reason many inhabitants of Nizhne-Imeritinskaya Bay haven't yet registered their land title in a proper way, or they are still in the process of registering their land title. In this case, there is no talk of market value or even of reasonable compensation; there is social tension, which has lead to numerous protests. Litigations on invalidating the resolution of the Governor of the Krasnodar area concerning land plots withdrawal haven't been realized, as a great number of legislative innovations, meant for simplifying the Olympic construction process, give opportunities for administrative discretion, when applied, but, unfortunately, at the same time they do not supply any protection of the titleholders' rights. And the judges have demonstrated their position clearly -- if a decree violates an applicant's legal rights or interests, but it formally complies with the law, there are no grounds for its invalidation. If the Olympic object arrangement only affects some insignificant part of the land plot, it is reasonable not to withdraw it in full, but to introduce a paid fixed easement, for example, i.e. a restricted right to use the land plot for public needs. Such an easement introducing procedure is organizationally simpler, and requires minimum of budget assets. In terms of the financial crisis, all the executors of the Olympic project continue to emphasize the need for costs optimization and more efficient use of the existing opportunities. Financing difficulties, significant reduction of credit assets leads to an inevitable decrease in investors, who undertake truly \"Olympic\" obligations. And the state suggests to the existing investors that construction volumes should be correspondingly increased. Thus, the Turkish company Kolin, which won the tender for constructing the sea port cargo zone, will have to equip yachting in the harbor waters now. Electricity suppliers across the country are cracking down as the number of delinquent private and corporate customers surges, as the dilapidated industry is mired in debt linked to unpaid consumer bills and the multibillion-dollar investment programs that investors signed onto during the privatization of Unified Energy System, which wrapped up just weeks before the financial crisis struck.",

  "text": "Cipolli, New London on the record. Ever since New London Police Chief Tom Cipolli made a public appeal to keep his job, New Londoners have been asking why Mayor Mike McBeth has been seeking to remove him. The mayor had planned to lay out his case at a public hearing on Tuesday, more than three months after the issue became public; but a 3-2 vote by the city council delayed that hearing until April, visibly frustrating McBeth and many of the 60 residents who turned out in search of answers. Neither McBeth nor Cipolli has publicly addressed the specific complaints behind McBeth\u2019s request to dismiss the chief. But the Mt. Pleasant News has reviewed legal documents filed as evidence in the matter, and Cipolli\u2019s formal response, which provide the clearest and most comprehensive look so far at the dispute between the two men. The files that accompany McBeth\u2019s request cite 21 different reasons that McBeth was to cite in support of the action \u2013 alleging improper conduct, poor management of the police force, insubordination, untruthful statements to police and city officials and general incompetence. Cipolli, who has called McBeth's accusations \"false and misleading,\" offers a broad response, including a look back at his nearly two years leading the New London Police Department, while responding to several of the claims made in McBeth's case. \"I strongly believe that I have changed the department for the better,\" Cipolli writes, asserting that crime in New London has fallen during his tenure, to which he credited better training and improved professionalism within the department and stronger relationships with the community. \"These positive relationships continue today,\" he writes, \"as do my efforts to insure New London is a safe community. \"The 119-page request includes seven affidavits, two from New London police officers, four from area residents and one from Winfield police chief John Chaney. At the end is a seven-page response from Cipolli. The full text of Cipolli's reponse, as well as each of the affidavits, can be read by following the links in this article. In addition, the files include e-mails from Cipolli, a section of the New London Code of Ordinances, Police Bill of Rights and police department manual, police expense reports and newspaper articles written on the matter. These are not included, but may be viewed, along with all other public documents, at the New London City Office, 112 W. Main St.",

  "text": "Culver pushing new rules on dependant adult abuse. Less than a month after creating a task force to address dependent adult abuse, Gov. Chet Culver is urging the legislature to begin making changes to strengthen and improve Iowa law. The governor received a series of initial legislative recommendations from the task force. Culver spoke about this issue today at a meeting of the Dependent Care Task Force, where he was joined by Government Oversight Committee co-chairs Sen. Rich Olive, D-Story City and Rep. Vicki Lensing, D-Iowa City. \u201cOver the past 30 years, bureaucracy at every level of government failed these men,\u201d said Culver. \u201cWe have a chance to rectify past mistakes by making the changes to our laws necessary to protect our most vulnerable Iowans and punish those who abuse them.\u201d The task force was formed following allegations about the treatment and living conditions of men at Henry\u2019s Turkey Service, a Texas-based company operating a bunkhouse in Atalissa.",

Henry County stands to receive about $36,000 in damages for the destruction of Bridge 136 over Big Creek, which collapsed in 2005 while a semi was attempting to cross it. The case went to a jury last week, with Trans Am Trucking Company, which operated the semi, seeking to pay no damages at all. Announcing the result at the county supervisors\u2019 meeting this morning, County Engineer Bill Belzer said the final award would be about $35,900, plus an unknown amount of interest. It was a considerably smaller amount than the county had hoped for. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get less than $50,000,\u201d Belzer said, \u201cconsidering the fact that Washington County had a smaller bridge that they got more money for.\u201d",

The Cookville Volunteer Fire Department will host its 19th annual fundraiser Saturday, March 28, from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the fire station in Cookville, located on County Road 4045, behind the Cookville store. According to Cookville Fire Chief Wesley McCollum, patrons attending can expect a family-friendly environment with a hip hop for the kids and dominoes for the adults, as well as a scrumptious spread including brisket, crawfish, baked beans, potato salad and desserts prepared by volunteers, families and community members. A pie and cake auction will also be held at 6 p.m., McCollum said, and door prizes will be given away. \"We have tons of door prizes people have donated, and we will probably be giving away around four an hour,\" McCollum said. The event will be free to the public but donations will be accepted and appreciated, he added. \"We know not everyone can afford to donate right now, but we want to welcome everyone to come out and visit with us and enjoy some good food and fun,\" McCollum said.",

  "text": "Regional Water Group meets in Mount Pleasant. The North East Texas Regional Water Planning Group (NETRWPG) held a meeting Wednesday afternoon at the Mount Pleasant Civic Center. Engineering Consultant Ray Flemons reviewed the status of draft reports on regional water supply planning for the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) Regional Water Plan to be completed in 2011. There was considerable discussion on the population projections. Flemons said that, while the TWDB at this date would not allow any change in the population figures for each county, his firm recommended changing the estimates within counties. He said the Texas State Demographer feels population is shifting from rural areas into cities above the 5,000 level. Board members decided that, rather than change the methodology of making population estimates, they would stay with the current figures until revised by the 2010 federal census. Another report being prepared is on the utilization of the region's brackish water, reported Flemons. The draft reports will be ready by mid-May, he said, in time for board members to read them before the next meeting. The board also heard a presentation from the City of Canton, which is planning to build a new city reservoir to meet it projected population needs. The city's representatives asked that their water system expansion be incorporated into the regional water plan. The next planning group meeting will be May 27, at 1 p.m., at the Mount Pleasant Civic Center.",

  "text": "Dumpster dive doesn't help fleeing suspect. On Thursday, March 26, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Titus County Sheriff's Office (TCSO) Deputy David Robinson and his canine partner, Browning, were on patrol and attempted to stop a vehicle on Edwards Street in Mount Pleasant for a traffic violation. The vehicle fled with Robinson's patrol unit in pursuit and Mount Pleasant Police Department (MPPD) patrol units on the way to assist Robinson. After turning onto West 16th Street, the vehicle's driver, Thomas Wayne Hellinghausen, 22, of Winfield, soon exited the moving vehicle and fled on foot. Deputies and officers from both departments converged on the scene and searched the area for Hellinghausen. As the search continued, MPPD officers located Hellinghausen in a nearby trash dumpster. As the deputies and officers spoke with the suspect, it was determined that Hellinghausen had ingested an unknown amount of methamphetamine before he bailed out of his vehicle. Hellinghausen was then transported to Titus Regional Medical Center to be treated. Hellinghausen was booked into the Titus County Jail where he was charged with a state jail felony charge of evading detention with a vehicle; a second state jail felony charge of possession of a controlled substance, penalty group one, under one gram; and a third degree felony charge of tampering with physical evidence.",

  "text": "Health is more than skin deep, says Dr. Greco. \"Dermatology is a wide-ranging specialty,\" according to Dr. Anthony Greco. \"It encompasses the spectrum of medical conditions. \"That explains why his practice n The Medical and Surgical Dermatology Center of Northeast Texas n is so busy, and also why he finds it so interesting. \"You learn something new every day. \"Dr. Greco has become a fixture in the Mount Pleasant medical community since coming here to practice in 1997, but his roots extend all the way to Canada - Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, to be exact, where he grew up. His mother's family was from Michigan, but he had an uncle who lived in Houston, and when he was young, he would him. Like so many transplants, his move to Texas was later partially motivated by the weather. \"I got tired of Canadian winters,\" he laughs. \"I liked the good climate like we have in Texas.\" He said he knew he wanted to be a physician from an early age. \"I was fascinated by medicine, I always knew I wanted to go into medicine. \"After he received his degree in internal medicine from the University of Toronto in 1992, he spent three years at McGill University in Montreal doing his dermatological residencyHe said he was proud to be accepted to study dermatology at McGill, one of the most prestigious universities in Canada. \"It's top notch and very competitive, it's very hard to get in there. \"Of all the sub-specialties in medicine, dermatology is one of the broadest because there are so many medical conditions that can manifest symptoms on the surface. A dermatologist needs to be familiar with at least 2,000 different conditions that might show signs or symptoms on or through the skin. \"You have to know a lot of internal medicine,\" he explains. He said he realized as soon as he started practicing in Mount Pleasant there was a great need to be served. People were traveling to Sulphur Springs, Greenville and as far as Dallas for their dermatological care. \"I've been super busy,\" he said, but he gets a lot of satisfaction from his work. The nature of dermatology is that his work usually shows results immediately, and patients are appreciative of that. \"You usually don't see chronic of end-stage illnesses,\" he said. \"You usually see results right away. \"Of course, skin cancer is one of the most common diseases he treats. It's not necessarily because of the blistering Texas sun, he notes. \"It's because there's a lot of fair-skinned people in Texas. \"He likes to keep up-to-date with the latest treatments, and he's proud to use the Mohs' surgery technique for skin cancer. Mohs surgery is microscopically controlled surgery that is highly effective for common types of skin cancer, with a cure rate cited by most studies between 97% and 99.8%. The Mohs procedure provides precise removal of the cancerous tissue, while healthy tissue is spared. It is essentially a pathology sectioning method that allows for the complete examination of the cancerous area. Dr. Greco says he is very satisfied with how well the Mohs' procedure cuts down on the skin cancer recurrence rate. Like all dermatologists, he says we should all protect ourselves from the sun. Every blistering sunburn causes permanent damage to skin cells, and constant exposure will make you age so much faster, he notes. Another problem he says is common, at least in this area, are tick bites. \"You'd be amazed, I've seen three people already this week with tick bites,\" he said. Tick bites can be potentially serious because ticks transmit Lyme Disease. He said he usually automatically starts tick bit victims on antibiotics. He urges people to do self-examinations and regular checkups of areas of potential concern, such as moles.",

  "text": "Police: Gunman's estranged wife worked at home. CARTHAGE, N.C. (AP) - Investigators are looking into whether a gunman accused of killing eight people in a North Carolina nursing home may have targeted the facility because his estranged wife worked there, police said Monday. Carthage Police Chief Chris McKenzie said the woman, who he did not name, worked at the nursing home. He said he believed that the couple were recently separated but that he did not have any other details. He was not sure if the woman was at the nursing home at the time of the shootings. Authorities said Robert Stewart, 45, went on a terrifying rampage in the Pinelake Health and Rehab center on Sunday morning, killing seven residents and a nurse and wounding three others. \"We're certainly looking into the fact that it may be domestic-related,\" McKenzie told The Associated Press ahead of a Monday morning news conference in this small town about 60 miles southwest of Raleigh in North Carolina's Sandhills region. An ex-wife of Stewart's, Sue Griffin, told reporters Sunday she had not had contact with him since they divorced in 2001 but that he had \"violent tendencies\". Griffin added she didn't know how her ex-husband was connected to the nursing home or why he would shoot people there. The injured included a police officer hailed as a hero for stopping the gunman by shooting and wounding him before more people could be killed. Officials said the shooting could have been bloodier if 25-year-old Carthage Police Officer Justin Garner hadn't wounded Stewart while trading gunfire in a hallway. Garner was wounded in the leg. \"He acted in nothing short of a heroic way today, and but for his actions, we certainly could have had a worse tragedy,\" said Moore County District Attorney Maureen Krueger. \"We had an officer, a well-trained officer, who performed his job the way he was supposed to and prevented this from getting even worse than it is now. \"Griffin, Stewart's ex-wife, said Stewart had been recently reaching out to family members, telling them he had cancer and was preparing for a long trip and to \"go away.\" Krueger said the victims were Pinelake residents Tessie Garner, 88; Lillian Dunn, 89; Jessie Musser, 88; Bessie Hendrick, 78; John Goldston, 78; Margaret Johnson, 89; Louise Decker, 98; and nurse Jerry Avent, whose age wasn't immediately available. Beverly McNeill said her mother, Pinelake resident Ellery Chisholm, called moments after the gunman stormed into her room and pointed his \"deer gun\" at her roommate. \"They're up here shooting, they're up here shooting,\" Chisholm frantically told her 14-year-old granddaughter, Tavia, over the phone, McNeil said. Chisholm told her daughter that she hid her face in her shirt so she couldn't see the man or what she expected him to do, McNeill said. He didn't shoot, but left the room and began shooting down the hallway. The facility was closed after the attack as authorities worked to gather evidence inside and out. Krueger declined to say if authorities had moved the surviving residents from the 110-bed facility, including patients with Alzheimer's disease, saying only, \"They're safe, which is the primary thing. \"Among the items investigators found was a camouflaged-colored rifle or shotgun, which was leaning against the side of a Jeep Cherokee in the parking lot. Sunday's rampage happened just weeks after a man killed 10 people, including his mother and several other relatives, in the worst mass shooting in Alabama's history on March 10. On March 11, a teen killed 12 people at his former high school in Germany.",

  "text": "Putting children on witness stand wrenching for all. BY RUSS ZIMMER Advocate Reporter March 15, 2009 NEWARK -- Unfortunately, it's not an unusual sight -- a child walking toward the witness stand, usually with something in his or her grip, like a stuffed animal or an adult's hand. The child climbs up into the chair, feet not even touching the floor, preparing to talk about something of a very adult nature. Six minors took the stand in their capacity as alleged victims in rape trials in 2007 and 2008, according to data gathered by The Advocate. Many more testified against defendants facing lesser offenses or were interviewed by medical professionals and law enforcement for those cases. Over the past month, juries acquitted two men accused of sexual conduct with a child younger than 13. Doubt was cast on the strength of the state's cases, including inconsistencies in the victims' testimony compared to previous statements and the investigators' methods. Children in each case were required to divulge the alleged conduct, answer legally necessary questions and be subject to cross-examination, all in front of strangers and in front of the defendant. Licking County Prosecutor Ken Oswalt said the convergence of all these elements make an adult victim nervous, let alone a child. These factors can make their testimony unpredictable and sometimes damaging to a case, he said. For those reasons, Oswalt said his office wants to avoid putting children who already have suffered a life-changing experience in that situation. \"We're not in the business of trying to further traumatize kids. ... We're in the business of trying to get people held accountable for the things they do,\" he said. After a child initially discloses abuse and it is reported to authorities, the child usually is taken to Kids' Place, which is a division of Licking Memorial Hospital. There, he or she will receive a physical exam much like any other trip to the doctor's office, but the child will be engaged in a conversation about the allegations, according to testimony in both trials. Newark police Detective Robert Huffman, who has been handling sexual offense investigations for 17 years, said the age of the child greatly affects the wording of the questions. \"The younger the child is, the more steps you have to take to guard against leading the child in any way,\" he said. \"What I try to do is let the child tell me what they want to tell me, really nothing more than that.\" Oswalt said his office tries to limit the number of interviews conducted and officials involved to minimize the embarrassment a child might feel. From Day 1, victims are offered aid through Licking County Victims' Services, which includes trial preparation, Victims' Services Director Mark Weiner said. He said his office tries to educate children about what to expect so they don't feel overwhelmed when they are called to testify. Sometimes they wonder why they have to talk to a room full of people, Weiner said. \"We tell them sometimes bad things happen and you got to go up there and tell the judge,\" he said. The relative tranquility of the witness waiting room alters the second the doors to the courtroom swing open and 14 jurors, attorneys, the judge, the court reporter and observers all are watching as the children make their way to the witness stand. Another set of eyes, the defendant's, also are fixed upon the accuser. Much of the possible inconsistencies in a child's statement might arise from this pressure, Oswalt said. Keep in mind the vast majority of these children are victimized by close relations, he added. \"That puts a young child in a situation of having competing interests or feelings -- maybe one of those is guilt,\" Oswalt said. \"It's a huge dynamic.\" Most of the discrepancies in a child's story heard in court are inconsequential to the question of guilt or innocence, he said. Children might not even consider details of the event important to an adult to be memorable, Oswalt added. \"Daddy touched me and it was yucky,\" he said referring to a typical reaction by an abused child. Huffman said he looks for authenticity in a child's statement in a number of ways, including having knowledge beyond their age. What authorities are listening for are \"things from the child that they should have no knowledge of because of their age. Those are red flags,\" Oswalt said. Consistency also can be checked by reviewing the story with the child and inserting something they didn't say to see if the child corrects them, Huffman said. Defense attorney Kristin Burkett, who represented the exonerated defendants in both unsuccessful prosecutions, grilled police on the lack of an accompanying video or audio tape with their interview notes. Time and again, she asked detectives and jurors how anyone could critique whether the interviews were conducted properly or if stark differences existed in the victim's account if there was no digital or analog record. One juror, who spoke to The Advocate after finding a defendant not guilty, said the lack of a recording and the definitive proof it would have contained influenced his decision. Burkett called it a \"huge problem\" Wednesday in an interview with The Advocate. \"I haven't spoke to an expert that doesn't believe those interviews should be taped,\" she said. \"If they are doing their job properly, there is no reason why they wouldn't want to tape it.\" Huffman said he personally favors taping, but the county has a policy against recording victim statements in child sexual abuse cases. Oswalt said what happens before and after the tape is switched off still will be open to scrutiny by defense attorneys. He added it was \"dead wrong\" to assume a recording would eliminate that same line of questioning. \"At the end of the day, you still need to trust the experience and integrity of the social workers and officers doing the case,\" Oswalt said. Burkett agreed with Oswalt that making a child testify in court is not the ideal outcome for the child. As a defense attorney, Burkett has to find a balance of aggressiveness and tact when questioning young witnesses. She said it's not like questioning an adult witness for the state. \"I don't want to do anything I don't have to when a child is on the stand, but I still have to represent my client,\" she said. Burkett described Licking County as generally a \"non-plea-bargaining jurisdiction\" but said these type of cases are the exception. Judges are more amenable to a reduced charge or disclosing their sentence in order to facilitate a plea, she said. There's little debate about the social stigma attached to sex offenses committed against children, and Burkett said even a not-guilty finding can't erase public perception of a defendant. \"People's lives are changed by the mere allegation of child sex abuse, and it doesn't go away,\" she said, \"which is why I believe these cases should be investigated more thoroughly than any other case.\" The children, win or lose in court, can bounce back with a strong support system, Weiner said. \"Kids are resilient, and with love and support they make it,\" he said.",

  "text": "Pataskala zoning allows fire-gutted block to be redeveloped. BY CHAD KLIMACK Advocate Reporter March 29, 2009 PATASKALA -- City officials say it might not be that difficult to redevelop a burned-out block downtown. Some officials initially thought it would take a zoning variance to rebuild two gutted buildings, but that might not be the case. \"It would appear somebody will be able to build a pretty substantial building there without going through a variance at all,\" said Diane Harris, the city's planning and zoning director. A March 7 fire, which investigators have labeled an arson, gutted most of a block on the west side of South Main Street, just south of the railroad tracks. Demolition crews subsequently tore down both 341 and 345 S. Main St. One of the buildings contained a heating and cooling businesses and the other was vacant. Mayor Steve Butcher initially thought the city's zoning would make it difficult for the current property owners -- or future ones -- to rebuild. However, he said that does not appear to be the case because the city's Downtown Business zoning designation permits developers to build something similar to what once stood there. In fact, the zoning would permit one of the property owners to build a three-story building containing up to 24,750 square feet. It would allow the other one to build a three-story building with up to 3,000 square feet. One of the property owners, Fred Ashbaugh, has said he intends to take his time in deciding whether to rebuild. He said he needs to take into account the lack of parking downtown and modern safety codes, in addition to the city's zoning. The other property owner, Claude Williams, could not be reached for comment. City officials have spoken to both property owners, and Butcher said Williams might not want to rebuild. \"We don't have any knowledge Mr. Williams is looking to develop his property, but we sure hope someone is,\" Butcher said. Harris, meanwhile, said the city would be willing to help someone find grants to rebuild. \"From my own perspective, I would like to see something that is respectful of the past,\" said Harris, adding she also would like to see someone build something that meshes with the rest of downtown. Butcher, meanwhile, said he would not be surprised if it takes both property owners time to decide how to proceed. A fire gutted he and his wife Nancy's restaurant, Nutcracker Family Restaurant, in 2005, and although the couple decided to reopen, the decision was not easy, he said. \"We went through the same struggle,\" Butcher said. \"Do we rebuild or do we take the (insurance) money?\"",

  "text": "Doctor returns to Newark after practicing in New Zealand. BY ABBEY ROY Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 NEWARK -- After spending a year on the other side of the equator, practicing at a rural New Zealand hospital with a total of nine beds, Jackie Underwood is thrilled to return home to Licking Memorial Hospital. \"It makes you appreciate here,\" Underwood said. \"It makes you appreciate the United States' private medicine.\" Underwood, a family practitioner at Licking Memorial from 1982-2006 and afterward in New Hampshire and Minnesota, left in January 2007 to practice in New Zealand after researching a brochure she'd received in the mail about the country. The experience was one she is grateful for, and she hopes to return to New Zealand as a tourist someday to explore the parts of it she missed this time around. Still, certain things New Zealand's culture took some getting used to, she said -- primarily, the country's national health care system. \"People have to wait a long time for things,\" Underwood said, citing examples such as tests or referrals. \"Things we take for granted here aren't taken for granted there.\" In New Zealand, she was one of six \"GPs\" -- general practitioners -- at the Queen Street Practice. The people in the town where she worked, Wairoa, were very friendly and mostly Maori, an indigenous group similar in culture, history and language to American Indians, Underwood said. Although the town was \"very blue-collar,\" she said, the citizens were kind and appreciated the care they received -- even if it was just a bit at a time. \"With the national health care ... people came in for one problem and one problem only,\" Underwood said. Additional maladies were required to be scheduled for different appointments. Although she had only 10 vacation days during her time in New Zealand, Underwood was able to accomplish a goal she had set for herself: scuba diving off the coast. When she returns as a tourist, she also hopes to tour the northernmost point of the country's North Island and the southernmost point of South Island, she said. In the meantime, she's content to be back at Licking Memorial, practicing with her old partner and enjoying facilities she said are better than any she's worked at. \"We have really good quality here,\" she said. \"There's a big focus here on quality.\"",

  "text": "Houses not selling despite low prices. BY KENT MALLETT Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 NEWARK -- The recent reported surge in home sales nationally has not yet reached Licking County, according to Licking County property transfer records provided by the county. The number of sales through March 15 dropped from 493 in 2008 to 309 this year, a 37 percent decline. The average sale price fell from $122,492 in 2008 to $110,416 so far in 2009, an almost 10 percent decrease. Jackie Lewis, president of the Licking County Board of Realtors, said she has seen signs better times are ahead, but buyers remain cautious. \"I can truly say people are out looking, but they're still hesitant to make up their minds because so many homes are sitting bank-owned,\" Lewis said. \"In warmer weather, people start to look.\" The National Association of Realtors reported sales of existing homes increased 5.1 percent in February compared to January, the largest monthly sales jump since July 2003. But local sales were virtually unchanged from January to February, according to the local board of Realtors. In the three Licking County cities of Newark, Heath and Pataskala, the sales through March 15 dropped from a combined 251 last year to 155 this year, a 38 percent tumble. Lewis predicts a surge not only because residents traditionally look more seriously in the spring, but also because of investors facing a tax deadline. They want to buy, Lewis said, because they have money they don't want taxed. The Licking County Board of Realtors reports home sales through its Multiple Listing Service fell during the first two months of the year, from 151 in 2008 to 114 this year, a 25 percent decline. Prices also dropped by 11 percent. Still, she thinks the deals are just too good for people to pass up much longer, and the increased sales elsewhere will begin to show up here. \"We see this in anything,\" Lewis said. \"It always hits the West Coast first and comes our way. Why? I have no idea. It's all about educating our buyers.\" Nathan Gill, a mortgage banker with American Eagle Mortgage Corp., said he has fielded an increase in phone calls requesting loan applications, mostly from first-time homebuyers. The reason for the increased interest, he said, probably is the federal tax credit available through Nov. 30. The refundable tax credit, on 2009 taxes filed in 2010, is for 10 percent of the sale price up to $8,000. \"I think the word is finally getting out,\" Gill said. \"We're trying to let people know there are advantages to purchasing homes right now. \"The tax credit, I believe, will have an effect this year. People have got to take advantage of it now.\" The Ohio Housing Finance Agency's Homebuyer Tax Credit Advantage Program, which starts March 30, allows homebuyers to use up to 3 percent of the purchase price for the down payment. They don't have to pay the loan back until July 1, 2010, he said Interest rates, Gill said, were available Friday at about 4.75 percent, compared to 8 percent in 2000, when homes were selling in large numbers.",

  "text": "Valley students trace their family genealogy. BY L.B. WHYDE Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 HANOVER -- The Licking Valley students in library media specialist Tracy Boehmer's E-Research class sat around the table with laptops and a volunteer from the Licking County Genealogy Society by their side. The room was hushed as eyes scanned the countless screens of information the students were scouring to find out more about their own family histories. Suddenly, there was a shout of success as Blake Holdsworth, 18, and her volunteer helper, Terry Cooperrider, discovered Holdsworth's many times-great-uncle with documents from 1355. Holdsworth was told by her grandfather, who is a poet, that she is related to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a popular American poet of the 19th century, whose famous phrases include \"ships that pass in the night\" and \"the patter of little feet.\" But this discovery confirmed she is related to the poet. \"I think it's really neat,\" Holdsworth said. \"I wanted to know exactly how I was related to him.\" The project is a collaboration between Boehmer and Raynola St. Clair, of the Licking County Genealogy Society. St. Clair wants to get the word out about the importance of knowing family history and the ways to research. The daylong session was open to all students interested in learning more about their ancestors. \"It's important to know how to research on line and what resources are available,\" Boehmer said. \"I am finding a lot is available from the Licking County Public Library. The LC Genealogical Society volunteers couldn't be more helpful.\" Lindsey Evans, 17, a senior, was digging into her family history and found documentation from a ship's passenger list that an ancestor came to this country from Germany in 1852. Senior Carrie Lough, 18, was working with St. Clair and trying to locate her great-great grandfather. Her father had just told her about him, saying he had fought in World War I. It wasn't long before St. Clair could verify that Hugh Jacobson did indeed fight in the war. \"It's really interesting. I never thought about genealogy before,\" Lough said. St. Clair is on a mission to spread the word about importance of family genealogy by giving seminars in the school, churches and one-on-one. Licking Valley High School is conducting another session next year. \"I especially want to get kids involved because they are the ones that will carry this on,\" St. Clair said. Terry Cooperrider, with the Licking County Genealogy Society, talks to Licking Valley senior Blake Holdsworth as they work on tracking Holdworth's family history online.

  "text": "Man cited for driving drunk after crashing motorized barstool. NEWARK \u0097 It was classified as \u201call others\u201d under vehicle type in the Newark police crash report, but that category doesn\u2019t do a motorized barstool justice. Its 28-year-old creator and operator was charged with operating a vehicle while intoxicated after he rolled over the Frankenstein-esque lawnmower-barstool hybrid, according to a police report and court records. On March 4, Officer Michael Trotter, one of the two members of the traffic unit, responded to the 500 block of Kelley Lane in reference to assisting Newark Fire with a man who had suffered injuries from a crash. Subsequent investigation revealed that the man had been operating the motorized barstool on Kelley Lane when he crashed it while trying to make a turn, the report states. The man claimed the barstool could reach speeds of 38 mph on its five-horsepower engine but that he was traveling at about 20 mph when he crashed it at 5:40 p.m., according to Trotter\u2019s report. He allegedly admitted to drinking about 15 beers during an interview with Trotter at the hospital, where he was transported after the crash. He was issued a citation for operating a vehicle while intoxicated and driving under suspension, according to court documents. The driver was arraigned last week and pleaded not guilty. He has demanded a jury trial. Newark police says operating any type of machinery after consuming alcohol often has devastating consequences.

  "text": "Family takes bait, opens fishing shop. By KENT MALLETT Advocate Reporter March 30, 2009 NEWARK \u0097 Wess Henry, who lost his home to foreclosure last year, was fishing for a way to change his luck. He hopes his fortunes change after he opened Drowned Worm Bait Shop on Friday the 13th of March. Henry and his son, Matt, are co-owners of the business at 197 N. Cedar St.Henry purchased the inventory of Newark Live Bait, which closed its Western Avenue business in January. He then found the rent at the Cedar Street location was affordable. The unlikely chain of events started when Matt Henry started planning for a fishing trip a few months ago. \u201cI called down there (to Newark Live Bait) to see what they wanted for bait and she said, \u0091I\u2019ll give you what I got because I\u2019m going out of business,\u2019\u201d Matt Henry said. \u201cAnd, she gave me a price for everything in the store. It was an offer we couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201d The Henrys had talked about opening a bait shop, but the did not know that Newark Live Bait was going out of business until his son stumbled onto the news. \u201cI\u2019d say it was fisherman\u2019s luck,\u201d Wess Henry said. \u201cEverything seemed to fall into place, If (Matt) hadn\u2019t decided to go fishing, it probably wouldn\u2019t be reality. I still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here.\u201d Wess Henry, 47, a 14-year employee of Tectum Inc., had just enough savings to start the business without a loan, which he said he probably could not have secured anyway. The Henrys said they have a good chance of developing a successful business once people discover them and their location because there is not much competition. \u201cThe fishermen are spreading the word amongst themselves,\u201d Wess Henry said. \u201cEveryone is so glad we\u2019re here because there\u2019s nowhere else to get bait. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to listen to what customers want. If people want something, I\u2019ll try to get it in within a week from the bait dealer.\u201d Wess Henry does have some retail experience. His parents had operated what Wess said was the largest bicycle shop in Licking County in the 1980s, Mound City Bicycle Shop on Idlewilde Avenue. The shop will continue the tradition from Newark Live Bait of providing fishing contests and offering a raffle and door prizes. Wess Henry also dabbles in woodworking and sells some of his work at the shop. The recession could actually work in the Henrys\u2019 favor in a couple ways, Matt said. \u201cIt may even spike when the economy is down because, when people are laid off, there is nothing else to do, and they may as well go fishing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s about the cheapest hobby left.\u201d Although fishermen can spend large amounts of money for equipment and boats, the Henrys said they also can get started with a license and minimal equipment for about $50. Another potential benefit from the poor economy is stimulus money offered from the government. Matt Henry applied for $100,000 to hire employees, purchase more inventory and even open up a second store. \u201cI said, just for the heck of it, apply for it,\u201d Wess said he told his son. Matt Henry, 24, said he\u2019s counting on the business lasting well into the future. \u201cI hope it\u2019s here for the next 40 years,\u201d Matt Henry said. \u201cEssentially, this is what I want to make my life\u2019s work.\u201d Matt Henry, left, and his father, Wess Henry, opened Drowned Worm Bait Shop at 197 N. Cedar St. (Michael Lehmkuhle, The Advocate)",

  "text": "Pakistan to restore chief justice ousted by Musharraf. ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistan agreed Monday to reinstate a fired chief justice, a move that will help defuse a political crisis that has sparked street battles and raised fears of instability in the country at a time of surging Islamist violence. Opposition leaders and lawyers had vowed to sit-in at the parliament later Monday until Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, known for his independence and willingness to challenge authority, was reinstated. The capital has been barricaded and scores of extra police brought in amid fears of violence. In a dawn address to the nation that capped a night of high drama, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani announced Chaudhry would be sworn in on March 21, the day the current chief justice was due to retire. The speech triggered scenes of jubilation outside Chaudhry's home in the capital, Islamabad. Gilani also ordered all lawyers and political activists arrested over the past week to be freed immediately. The concession came as thousands of protesters led by Nawaz Sharif, the head of the largest opposition party and a longtime foe of President Asif Ali Zardari, were traveling to Islamabad to join the planned sit-in. Sharif joined the convoy after ignoring a house arrest order in his hometown of Lahore in Punjab, where his supporters fought running battles with police. \"This is a victory for the people of this country,\" said Baz Mohammad Kakar, a leader of the lawyers' movement. \"Chaudhry is the first chief justice in the history of Pakistan who has proved himself to be a judge for the people, as a chief justice for the people.\" Former President Pervez Musharraf fired Chaudhry, 60, in 2007 after he took up cases challenging the leader's rule, sparking a wave of protests that helped force Musharraf from power in 2008. Musharraf's successor, Zardari, pledged to reinstate Chaudhry within 30 days of taking office, but reneged on the promise, apparently fearing the justice might examine a deal that he and his wife, slain politician Benazir Bhutto, struck with Musharraf to grant the pair immunity from prosecution over alleged corruption cases. Lawyers and civil rights activists have remained committed to the cause of Chaudhry's reinstatement, believing it was a vital first step in getting an independent judiciary in Pakistan.",

  "text": "Salmon collapse caused by natural, manmade causes. The roots of last year's unprecedented decision to close the California coast to salmon fishing took hold three years earlier, in the spring of 2005 when juvenile fish swam through the Golden Gate to an ocean lacking ample food for them, a new report says. On the Farallon Islands bird sanctuary, nearly all the Cassin's auklets, which eat the same kind of food as juvenile salmon, abandoned their nests that year. Gray whales that migrate along the coast were reported emaciated and sea lions were found searching for food far from shore. The salmon that would have returned to spawn in 2007 starved, or were weakened and eaten by other fish or birds. The same thing happened in 2006, causing low numbers to return again last year. Naturally varying ocean conditions were the immediate cause of a fishing season closure for which $170 million in federal disaster funds were made available last year, according to a report released Wednesday by a team of scientists assigned last year to investigate the collapse. But if ocean conditions have always varied, why did the salmon numbers fall so precipitously? The scientists who wrote the report contend that while ocean conditions were bad, California's salmon have been so weakened by loss of habitat, water diversions and reliance on hatcheries that they were especially vulnerable. The report focused on the cause of the commercially valuable workhorse of California's salmon fishery \u2014 the Sacramento River fall run of chinook salmon. Those fish may have produced as many as 900,000 spawners in years past, but in 2007 just 88,000 fish returned. Last year was even lower, and regulators expect just 122,000 spawners this fall. The National Marine Fisheries Service, meanwhile, has concluded that state water operations are threatening other salmon runs, steelhead, green sturgeon and the Puget Sound population of salmon-eating orcas \u2014 even to the point of extinction. That agency is expected to develop new restrictions on water managers by June. But for the fall run, the biggest problems have been ocean conditions and a heavy reliance on hatcheries to produce fish \u2014 hatcheries that are meant to make up for the loss of spawning habitat that is blocked by dams. In particular, California's rivers and streams produced so few wild salmon that as much as 90 percent of the state's salmon, according to one recent study, have evolved in hatcheries. The lack of genetic diversity leaves salmon as vulnerable to ups and downs as an investor without a diversified portfolio. \"The system we have of having everything the same, we can expect less variation, and we can expect more booms and busts,\" said Churchill Grimes, director of a federal fisheries science laboratory in Santa Cruz and co-leader of the study. \"You don't have any hedging.\" In the past, if food was scarce in the spring there might still be a lot of juvenile salmon swimming under the Golden Gate later in the spring when the food might be available. But not so in recent years. The lack of food off the coast in the spring of 2005 and 2006 was caused by the weak upwelling \u2014 where nutrient-rich waters off the coast rise toward the surface and, in a good year, cause an explosion of marine life that is especially apparent in places like the Farallon Islands. The head of a major commercial fishing association said the report was on the right track but too heavily focused on ocean problems, for which little can be done. \"They got it about half-right,\" said Zeke Grader, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. \"We've got to be able to get these fish down the rivers, through the Delta to the ocean. These are things they have avoided in the past because they're controversial.\" Grader contends that dams, pumps and water management policies are to blame for the collapse. Ocean conditions have improved in recent years and that, combined with new restrictions on water pumping out of the Delta, could help fuel a recovery next year, Grader said. It's virtually assured that regulators will close the California coastal salmon fishing season to commercial anglers again this year. A final recommendation is expected to be made at a meeting in early April in Millbrae.",

  "text": "Local mayors hit streets with Meals on Wheels. FREMONT \u2014 Violet Stubblefield had a look of surprise when she opened the door Wednesday morning. On a typical day, the 96-year-old Fremont woman receives a lunch delivery from Linda Wasserman, a 16-year volunteer with Fremont-based LIFE ElderCare Meals on Wheels. But on this day, Wasserman brought along a special guest \u2014 her husband, Bob, the city's mayor. \"Hi, nice to meet you,\" the mayor said, extending his hand for a handshake. \"It's nice to meet you, too \"... I read about you all the time,\" said Stubblefield, who later joked that she would have worn her Oakland A's hat had she known the mayor would be coming. Wasserman was a big A's supporter when the team proposed moving to Fremont. Wasserman was one of three local mayors to go into their communities Wednesday to deliver meals to senior citizens as part of the annual Mayors for Meals Day. Mayors David W. Smith of Newark and Michael Sweeney of Hayward also delivered food to their constituents, joining more than 1,000 mayors across the country in the effort. Each day, 2,200 homebound seniors in Alameda County receive food from one of six regionally run Meals on Wheels programs. For these seniors, the visits are more than just a meal delivery service; they're a chance to talk to someone. \"It does put you in touch with reality,\" he said. Wasserman said he enjoyed the experience and opportunity to get into the community. He said he also appreciates the efforts of the everyday volunteers \u2014 the 225 in the Tri-City area \u2014 who work together to deliver some 350 meals a day, 90,000 annually. How to help For more information about Meals on Wheels in the Tri-City area, contact LIFE ElderCare at 510-574-2091. In the Hayward area, contact the Hayward Service Opportunity for Seniors at 510-582-1263.",

  "text": "New Haven trustees consider parcel tax. UNION CITY \u2014 Hoping to avert further erosion of district services because of state budget cuts, the New Haven school board has hired consultants to determine the likelihood that voters would support a parcel tax to fund school programs. But board members are split over whether to ask voters for money when families increasingly are strapped for cash. One trustee, who supported further consideration of a tax, implied that the timing is not ideal. Just last November, voters agreed to tax themselves $3.2 million annually for eight years to pay for public-safety services. Nevertheless, school board President Gertrude Gregorio said, \"We cannot wait for Sacramento to give us adequate funding. ... I know this is not the best time to ask our community for more money, but ... if the budget continues the way it is, there's no way we can afford to give our children (what we want). It's an expensive proposition, but it's needed.\" In a 3-2 vote, with trustees Michelle Matthews and Gwen Estes dissenting, the board on Tuesday approved hiring two consulting groups for a maximum of $54,500 to conduct initial assessments to determine voter interest in a tax. Any decision to place a tax measure on a ballot would require another board vote. At this point, Superintendent Kari McVeigh said, \"What we're really trying to find out is, 'Will this community support any parcel tax, and if so, under what terms and how much?'\" \" Another firm, Hahn and Associates, will act as political consultants and help craft messages to the public about the need for a tax. Last spring, the school board slashed $7 million. This year, it's made $4 million in budgetary adjustments through cuts and borrowing money from itself, and has approved $5.9 million more in cuts from the 2009-10 and 2010-11 budgets. With the reductions, the district plans to increase class sizes, stop offering co-curricular activities, eliminate its busing program and possibly close an elementary school in the next two years. New Haven is not the only district to consider turning to voters for additional revenue. The Fremont school board recently directed its superintendent to meet with consultants to discuss a similar parcel tax and is scheduled to receive an update next week. Newark officials also have mentioned the idea of a tax measure.",

  "text": "Old bills never die, they just wait for votes. Bay Area lawmakers continue to resurrect bills that died in previous Congresses, hoping that having a wider margin of majority in the House and a Democrat in the White House could bring the bills success this time around. For example, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, and U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., today reintroduced their Responsible Education About Life, or REAL, Act, which would authorize federal funding for comprehensive, age-appropriate, medically accurate sex education. For now, such funding is available only for abstinence-only-until-marriage programs, which have been shown to exclude important information about contraception as a protection against pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. \"It's time for us to get REAL about sex education,\" Lee said in her news release. \"We should absolutely be teaching young people about abstinence, but we shouldn't be holding back information that can save lives and prevent unwanted pregnancies. Instead of 'abstinence only,' what we're proposing is 'abstinence-plus.' \" Elsewhere, Rep. Jerry McNerney, D-Pleasanton, today introduced H.R.1546, the Caring for Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 2009. The bill would establish a special panel within the Department of Veterans Affairs to assess the department's capacity to treat veterans who have traumatic brain injuries as well as to make recommendations on developing policies for care and rehabilitation. It also would help establish TBI-specific education and training programs for VA's health professionals. \"Many of our soldiers who have been wounded in Iraq have experienced a traumatic brain injury. In fact, traumatic brain injuries are the hallmark injuries of this war,\" McNerney said in his news release. \"It is incumbent on us to ensure that the (Department of Veterans Affairs) is equipped and ready to provide the ongoing services necessary to fully address the impact of traumatic brain injuries.\" McNerney had introduced a similar bill in May 2007, but that bill never emerged from committee. Tom Del Beccaro of Lafayette, vice chairman of the California Republican Party, today is helping to launch a new political action committee, called the \"First Amendment Now Campaign.\" The PAC is intended to combat what Del Beccaro says are Democratic efforts to curtail conservative political speech. The main issue is the Fairness Doctrine, a Federal Communications Commission policy dating from 1949 but abolished in 1987 that required broadcast license holders to present controversial issues of public importance in a way the FCC considered honest, equitable and balanced. Although President Barack Obama repeatedly has said he opposes reinstating it and the U.S. Senate last month overwhelmingly approved an amendment nixing it, conservatives have continued to rally against it, leading some critics to wonder whether it's an intentional effort to dangle some red meat as a distraction from other issues. Still, Del Beccaro, California Political News and Views publisher Steve Frank and state Sen. Tony Strickland, R-Moorpark, along with a bunch of conservative talk-radio personalities, are launching this new organization, asking for donations of $17.76 \"to preserve our freedom.\" Besides the Fairness Doctrine, they say, they're concerned about Obama's calls for \"localism,\" or requiring broadcast license holders to dedicate some of their airtime to the interests of their local community \u2014 obviously a concern for a conservative station such as KSFO-AM/560 that's located in an overwhelmingly liberal media market such as the Bay Area. And they're also worried about Obama's calls for broadcast media ownership diversity, dating to 2007 and echoed now in Congress. The president and supporters claim they're concerned about a lack of female and minority ownership in the broadcast media, but opponents claim it's just another backdoor way to undercut conservative free speech. So, expect to hear a lot about this all across your AM radio dial as this new organization holds a kickoff rally Tuesday in Sacramento, on the Capitol's north steps, and as it moves forward with an effort to gather a million petition signatures that it can present to U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, both of California. The PAC promises to use its money \"to preserve the First Amendment; to oppose the Fairness Doctrine, government-imposed diversity and localism; and to oppose candidates that favor the Fairness Doctrine.\"",

This story reflects her love for baseball and its impact on her family. * * *It's the crack of the bat, the roar of the crowd. Baseball season is just around the corner. Springtime brings warm weather, new flowers and baseball. Only true baseball fans think this way and I can attest to being one of them. At a very young age, I already knew baseball was special and important to my family. Many times baseball was the talk around our dinner table and when the new Minnesota Twins baseball franchise first had its game broadcast on the radio in 1960, my dad listened almost religiously. Farm work could wait a few hours. As I grew older, the family baseball tales were imprinted on my brain. My dad played the game and remembered the greats like Babe Ruth - idols for all the players who dreamed of glory while playing town team baseball. Baseball here in Cedar County goes back more than 100 years and still has dedicated players and fans. It was a regular source of entertainment, and a source of bragging rights for years to come. A few years ago, I wrote a story about local Cedar County town baseball, \"The Boys of Summer\" for the Daily News. Much to my surprise, I was subsequently contacted by Rick Baxter, president of the Nebraska State Baseball Association, who had read the article. From him, I learned about the Nebraska Baseball Hall of Fame and its Web site. A year ago, I decided what a wonderful tribute it would be to my father's family to submit their names for consideration. Last fall, I was notified - they were in. Just on Sunday, we accepted a medal of honor for the Bernard Becker family, and no one was probably prouder than my brother and I.I'm sure my dad and uncles were standing right there beside us. I could feel their baseball spirit gently whispering in our midst. \"Let's play ball.\"",

  "text": "Economy affecting high school, college students. Janet Johnson, a guidance counselor at Norfolk High School, works with Brenda Mercado, a junior at Norfolk High, on some college and career options. Johnson said she\u2019s aware of a number of high school students who are having to work part time while going to high school in order to help support their families during this challenging economic times. Thinking of taking a year or two off after high school to work before starting college? If so, Janet Johnson, a guidance counselor at Norfolk High School, has some advice to offer. First, it's important for students to check what will happen to their health insurance if they hope to stay on their parents' coverage but do not attend school full time. That can be a big consideration for some young people. \"The other thing that I encourage them to do is if they're going to work full time is to really stop and plan how they're going to budget their money so that they don't get used to having all of that income,\" Johnson said. \"If they return to school and have fewer hours and their expenses have expanded to their whole paycheck, that can be really difficult. \"Johnson said it's important for these young people to make a budget so they know how much they can afford to spend and save each month so they do not become over-obligated financially. A period of full-time work can sometimes be an encouragement to certain young people who have postponed college, she said. \"Sometimes that year or two off working full time or working at a job that maybe really isn't their favorite thing to do can be kind of motivating,\" Johnson said. \"Going to college becomes an incentive to getting a job that a (young person) wants more then the job they're currently doing. \"Johnson said taking time off between high school and college can be a challenge for some students academically. Study habits, formulas in math and concepts in science and English may be forgotten over time, but Johnson said colleges provide tutoring and resource centers for students who need extra help.",

  "text": "Pack, troop members to 'scout for food'. Twenty-three Boy Scout and Cub Scout units from throughout Northeast Nebraska's Diamond Dick District will help fight hunger in \"Scouting for Food 2009\" scheduled for Saturday, April 4. Scouts first will be distributing door hangers this Saturday, March 28, in Norfolk and area communities. The door hangers will provide information about plans to pick up donated non-perishable food items starting at 8 a.m. on April 4. The food items collected will be given to local food pantries. Five Scout units from Norfolk - Pack 122, 124 and 131 and Troop 122 and 124 - will collect items for the Salvation Army, Improved Living Norfolk food bank and the Trinity Episcopal Church food pantry. Hy-Vee East, Hy-Vee West and Lou's Thrifty Way will be helping this year by having a collection site where consumers can drop off items in the stores this week through April 4. Scouts will pick them up and deliver those items to food pantries, too. In addition to the Norfolk, efforts:- Pack 198 and Troop 198 from Battle Creek will be collecting for the Battle Creek food pantry. - Pack 174 and Troop 174 from Wayne, with help from Pack 179 and Troop 179 from Winside, will be collecting for the Wayne Food Pantry. - Pack 149 and Troop 149 from Bloomfield will be collecting for the Knox County Food Pantry. - Pack 178 and Troop 178 from Pierce will be collecting for the Food Bank at the United Congregational Church of Christ in Pierce. But they will be picking up items already on March 28. - Pack 167 and Troop 167 from Neligh will be collecting for the Antelope County Food Pantry. - Other units from Northeast Nebraska helping this year includes Pack 136 of Madison; Pack 162 of Plainview; Pack 170 of Thurston; Troop 172 of Wakefield; Pack 176 of Laurel; and Troop 208 of Coleridge. Scouting for Food is the Mid-America Council's annual \"good-turn event,\" officials said. * * *Want to learn more?

  "text": "Vandals target 4x4s in Oxford. A SPATE of vandalised 4x4 vehicles has sparked fears an eco-fanatic is targeting \u201cgas guzzling\u201d cars in Oxford. Builder Phillip Bradley has seen his new \u00a325,000 Isuzu attacked outside his home in Osney Island four times, leaving him with a \u00a31,700 repair bill. Over the past fortnight his vehicle has been vandalised twice. Another 4x4 owner nearby has also had his windscreen of his Toyota Hilux repeatedly smashed since January. People in Osney Island have been shocked by the level of car vandalism in recent weeks, with the damage always happening at weekends in the early hours of the morning. But residents are now convinced the vandalism is not random, as 4x4s are suffering the brunt of the attacks. One owner on Osney Island has now taken to sleeping in his vehicle at night in the hope of catching his tormentor. And he has also had CCTV cameras put in front of his house. Mr Bradley said his Isuzu Denver Rodeo was first damaged just two days after he bought it in October, when the windscreen was smashed. The car had been parked outside his home in West Street. The latest attack happened on Friday night when the windscreen was again smashed and the bonnet pierced \u2014 apparently with a heavy metal spike. Mr Bradley, a father-of-two who owns the building firm Attics +, said he was disturbed at 4am by a loud smashing noise. He had been sleeping in the front bedroom of his house to keep watch over his vehicle. But the offender had fled down Swan Street by the time he had rushed to his car. Mr Bradley said: \u201cI had thought I was the victim of some personal vendetta when if first happened. But then I heard about another guy in East Street having his 4x4 damaged. I don\u2019t believe we are talking about youngsters who have been to the clubs, or the hooded crew. This seems to be someone who is on a mission. \u201cIt is someone who is going to keep on coming back until he is caught. \u201cMy guess is that it\u2019s someone who perceives cars like mine to be a \u2018gas guzzler\u2019. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. It actually takes diesel. I bought it because it\u2019s a nice car for the family and I can also use it at work. The owner of the vandalised Toyota Hilux is Ian Beesley, also a builder, who lives on Ferry Hinksey Road. Mr Beesley, widely known as Digger, said his car had been parked on only yards from his home when it was vandalised. He also feared a misguided ecologically-minded fanatic was the most likely culprit. A spokesman for Oxford Police said: \u201cThe neighbourhood policing team have increased their patrols in the area and are carrying out investigations to catch those responsible.\u201d",

  "text": "Students go into Oxford's Dragon's Den. SCHOOLCHILDREN in Oxford have been putting forward business ideas before a panel of \u201cBusiness Angels\u201d in the city\u2019s own version of hit television programme Dragon\u2019s Den. Pupils from three city schools gave pitches to a panel of Angels under the new Business X scheme \u2014 all for a share of \u00a330,000. Pupils at Matthew Arnold School, in Botley, St Gregory the Great School in East Oxford and Magdalen College School, Cowley Place, have been working on their proposals for months with the help of MBA students from the Said Business School. After several hours, the panel of venture capitalists, businessmen and women and entrepreneurs, agreed to invest in two of the schemes, pending further information. St Gregory the Great School\u2019s team, which was seeking funds to develop a community allotment, got the backing of the panel. They asked for \u00a34,800 and have been told they will get financial backing, though the final figure has not yet been agreed. Team member Vaughan Matthews, 17, from Cowley, said: \u201cIt was a great experience. It was very difficult. Most of us have seen Dragon\u2019s Den and you can criticise the show, but until you\u2019re in that position, you can\u2019t describe what it\u2019s like.\u201d Philip Blackwell, from the Blackwell family behind the famous Broad Street bookshop, told the group: \u201cWe loved it and we thought you were enthusiastic, ambitious, and your scheme had great environmental and social benefits.\u201d The Angels decided against investing in Matthew Arnold School\u2019s specialist puzzle cube, but were so impressed by the way the group worked together, they offered to work with them to find a different product. They had asked for \u00a315,000 for a laser cutter to create the cube, aimed at the disabled market. Adam Newport, 14, from Botley, said: \u201cWe have all put a lot of work in this, all of us have pulled our weight and it has been interesting.\u201d Two different groups from Magdalen College School took part in the contest, with business ideas for a yearbook company and for an environmental social networking site. The panel decided to invest in the first scheme, but not in the second. Ely Sandler, from the yearbook project called Form, said: \u201cWe have put a lot of effort into this and Business X has been very helpful. \u201cIt is a really good idea and it\u2019s a great way to get us started.\u201d The different groups will report back to the Business Angels on July 1. Venture capitalist Martin Chilcott, who came up with the scheme and was on the panel, said: \u201cWe were enormously impressed with the quality of the work and of the presentations, energy, enthusiasm and passion.\u201d",
